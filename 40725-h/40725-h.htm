<h2 id="c1"><br />CHAPTER I
<br />The Warning</h2>
<p>For a few uncertain moments no one had spoken.
The old flivver bumped over a little hill, and the girls
seemed suddenly to realize they were entering upon
that much anticipated new experience&mdash;college life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lovely, isn&rsquo;t it!&rdquo; exclaimed Arden Blake, resting
her hand on Terry&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Such beautiful
pines&mdash;so tall and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mysterious!&rdquo; supplied Sim Westover, making a
dive for her compact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you. I was about to say&mdash;stately,&rdquo; remarked
Arden with assumed superciliousness. &ldquo;And
see the deer behind the bush, a stone deer, I suppose.
But it&rsquo;s all so lovely!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lovely indeed,&rdquo; agreed Terry as she was apt to
do with anything Arden said or did. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think
so, Sim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sim, occupying most of the back seat of the rickety
station car, felt differently about it and said so. Sim
was that way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well,&rdquo; she murmured, busy with her
compact, &ldquo;all very well, my good girls, but isn&rsquo;t it
about time we got inside the college? After a train
trip like the one we have just endured, I&rsquo;ll be glad to
get my feet off Arden&rsquo;s suitcase. Wherever did you
get such a big one, Arden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was given to me when we all decided to come
to Cedar Ridge. You&rsquo;ll wish it was yours when you
see what&rsquo;s inside. Oh, look! That must be the swimming-pool
building!&rdquo; There could be no mistake about
it as they could note when the harassed little flivver
was slowly completing the half circle of the cinder
drive which curved like a crescent moon in front of
Cedar Ridge College, and was approaching a glass-roofed
structure set somewhat apart from the other
buildings.</p>
<p>The roof was dome-shaped, and its glass panes, set
in frames of copper which glinted in the rays of the
red autumn sun, were thick and green like petrified
ocean waves.</p>
<p>As they rattled past the pool building they saw a
wheelbarrow standing right in the pathway. Somehow
that odd obstruction looked out of place near a natatorium,
and Sim said so, adding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what&rsquo;s the idea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re probably just cleaning it out,&rdquo; suggested
Arden.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>The cultivated rustic setting for the big gray stone
structures made the whole scene picturesquely perfect,
just as the prospectus had stated. But to the girls the
college was also a little forbidding. Certainly there
was nothing cozy about it&mdash;nothing inviting&mdash;and not
every girl can boast the artist&rsquo;s taste.</p>
<p>The buildings were solid and massive, as solid and
dependable as the women instructors within who
guided the four student years of &ldquo;their girls.&rdquo; Besides
the swimming pool, only the chapel, with its tall spire,
caught the warm sunset glow and displayed it more
lavishly. But that, of course, thought Arden, was because
there was so much more glass, beautifully tinted,
in the chapel windows.</p>
<p>As the wheels of the car crunched the cinders, Arden
hoped she hadn&rsquo;t been wrong in urging Terry and Sim
to come to Cedar Ridge with her. They had come
because of her urging. There was no doubt of this.
Had it not been for the promise of swimming, implied
by the beautiful picture of the pool in the college
prospectus, Sim would, she said, have been content to
stay at home in Pentville.</p>
<p>As for Terry&mdash;where Arden went, there went
Terry. They had been inseparable since the &ldquo;baby
grade&rdquo; in Vincent Prep.</p>
<p>The driver of the car, a typical country taxi-man,
probably too well trained to talk unbidden to the
students, pulled up suddenly as he neared a lane that
curved around a big elm and wended its way toward
a distant grove.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Down below there&rsquo;s th&rsquo; orchard,&rdquo; he said hesitantly.
&ldquo;Ef I was you, I wouldn&rsquo;t go prowlin&rsquo; around
in it.&rdquo; He indicated a part of the extensive farm
ground that was an inheritance of Cedar Ridge College&mdash;long
rows of old gnarled trees, many of them
now heavy with russet, red, golden, and yellow fruit.
The orchard was separated from the eastern end of
the dormitory building by a tall and tangled hedge
but could be seen from the hill on which the building
stood. &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t go down there,&rdquo; advised the driver
as he let in the clutch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; came a surprised and gasping chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waal, queer things are said to happen down in that
orchard. But don&rsquo;t ask me what!&rdquo; he quickly cautioned.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only hired to drive this tin Lizzie, an&rsquo; I
dassn&rsquo;t talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terry, who sat beside Arden, evinced a desire to
put a question but thought better of it.</p>
<p>The girls looked wonderingly at one another as the
car speeded along. They were puzzled over this mysterious
introduction to Cedar Ridge. For here was the
college. That was no mystery but a solid fact.</p>
<p>They were there!</p>
<p>The flivver chugged on to the main entrance, and
the girls alighted. As they reached the top of the
massive stone steps, a young man, porter evidently,
picked up their bags as the taxi-man slid them along
to him and quickly led the way inside the portals.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>The very sight of a young man there, at this college
for girls, even clad, as he was, in blue overalls,
prompted a giggle. But Arden pinched Sim&rsquo;s arm and
Sim didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Just inside the doorway, at a desk near which the
young man set down the bags, sat a severe-looking
woman in black with the judicious linen collar and
cuffs. She waited with a pencil poised over a large
sheet of paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose this is where we are expected to register,&rdquo;
murmured Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Terry, as usual.</p>
<p>They gave their names to the severe woman, who
permitted herself a frosty smile as she remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, freshmen. You young ladies have all been
assigned to the same room. Let me see.&rdquo; She consulted
a list. &ldquo;It is number 513 on the fifth floor of the main
building.&rdquo; She made a note on the paper, and then,
turning, addressed a distant shadowy corner, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Everett will show you where it is. You may
go to your room now, and when you hear the bell you
will come to the recreation hall, which you will pass
on your way. Miss Everett!&rdquo; she called sharply.</p>
<p>A tall blonde girl came forward from the shadows,
a little reluctantly, it appeared. Just why, neither
Arden nor her two chums could imagine. They didn&rsquo;t
even know, yet, who Miss Everett was. This stately
blonde girl, however, took matters into her own hands
with some show of authority.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come this way, please,&rdquo; she said, addressing the
three freshmen. They were a little uncertain whether
or not to pick up their bags, now that the luggage
had been brought into the building for them. But Miss
Everett knew what to do.</p>
<p>The young fellow in the clean suit of blue overalls
could now be seen at the end of the corridor. He was
apparently deeply interested in the outside view, for he
stood squarely before a window and seemed oblivious
of his humble duties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom!&rdquo; sharply called Miss Everett. At that the
blue-clad man turned quickly and hurried toward the
desk. &ldquo;These bags to the fifth floor, Tom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m,&rdquo; he murmured. He kept his head bowed.
Perhaps he still wanted to retain that vision of the
apple orchard in which he had been so interested. For
it was toward the orchard he had been looking, as
Arden and her chums noted when they went down
toward the window. They could see the strange
gnarled trees over the top of the high dark hedge.
&ldquo;Fifth floor?&rdquo; questioned Tom, the porter. He was
also an assistant gardener, as the girls later learned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Room 513,&rdquo; added the woman at the desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>Arden thought she saw a little smile playing over
the face of the good-looking young man as he started
off ahead of the three freshmen, led by the stately
Miss Everett. The porter was evidently going to a
service elevator, as he passed out through a side door
and was then lost to sight, with the bags he carried
so efficiently, all three of them, and not small, either.</p>
<p>Arden, Terry, and Sim, following Miss Everett,
started up the brown polished stairs that reared skyward
at the back of the large entrance hall.</p>
<p>Up and up and up they walked. All the landings
and halls looked exactly alike, and the freshmen wondered
how their guide retained her sense of direction
and maintained the count.</p>
<p>Halfway up Terry murmured to Arden:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think there was anything in what he said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The taxi-man who drove us here from the station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The orchard. You know he warned us to keep
away from it. And if there is something terrible or
scary about an orchard so near the college, why, I&rsquo;m
going&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to keep right on walking up!&rdquo; interrupted
Arden with her usual clear-headedness in a
critical situation. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s any mystery here at
Cedar Ridge we&rsquo;ll have the time of our lives solving
it. But I don&rsquo;t believe there is. That orchard is no
different from any other, except, from what little we
saw of it, there seemed to be some fine apples there.
Now don&rsquo;t go making mountains out of the camel in
the eye of the needle, or something like that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; said Terry meekly. &ldquo;But I was
thinking&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is no time to think!&rdquo; came from Sim. &ldquo;Use
your legs! Whew! Five flights! Is your room this
high up, Miss Everett?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m a sophomore. I&rsquo;m a floor lower than you
are. But this is the fourth time I&rsquo;ve taken freshies
up here today. I don&rsquo;t see why they have to pick on
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, this is too bad!&rdquo; exclaimed Sim impulsively.
&ldquo;Perhaps if you could have a swim in the pool before
dinner tonight you wouldn&rsquo;t feel so tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Sim a dive into a pool with sea-green tiles on
the bottom was a cure-all and she recommended it at
every opportunity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try a swim,&rdquo; she urged.</p>
<p>Miss Everett came to a sudden stop on a landing
and laughed in a manner that could be described only
as cynical.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, freshie!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;let me tell you
something about that pool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three girls looked at their guide apprehensively.</p>
<p>Was there something mysterious about the pool, as
the taxi-man had intimated there was about the
orchard?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><br />CHAPTER II
<br />Fruit-Cake</h2>
<p>Waiting, with the deference they, as freshmen,
guessed was due a sophomore, Arden, Terry, and Sim
looked at Miss Everett. There was a smile on her lips,
but there was no mirth in her words as she went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nobody in the world who could have a
swim in that pool!&rdquo; said the tall blonde girl, and one
could only surmise whether there was exultation or
vindictiveness in her tones. &ldquo;A swim in that pool!
Don&rsquo;t make me laugh! Why, Tiddy, our revered head,
uses it as a storehouse for cabbages, potatoes, and
turnips that come out of the college garden. Swimming
pool&mdash;ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that accounts for the wheelbarrow,&rdquo; murmured
Sim in a strained voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wheelbarrow? Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Miss Everett.
&ldquo;They cart the cabbages, potatoes, and turnips to the
pool in the wheelbarrow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And apples?&rdquo; asked Arden who, as were her
chums, had been taken somewhat aback by this information.
Yet Arden couldn&rsquo;t help mentioning
apples. She remembered the orchard, about which the
taxi-man had so mysteriously hinted and toward
which Tom, the porter, had been gazing so steadfastly.
What was in the orchard, anyhow? Arden
Blake wondered while she waited for the tall blonde
girl&rsquo;s reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, apples in season,&rdquo; granted Miss Everett.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a big orchard here, a fine orchard, as
orchards go, I suppose, though, really, I don&rsquo;t know
much about them. But we have a crabbed old college
farmer who seems well up in that work. And there&rsquo;s
Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; asked Terry for she saw no signs of the
good-looking young fellow in blue overalls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;s here now,&rdquo; Miss Everett
made haste to reply, with somewhat more interest in
her voice. &ldquo;But he too seems fascinated by our
orchard. He seems to know a lot about apples. Yes,
they&rsquo;ll store some in the swimming pool, but mostly
potatoes, cabbages, and turnips go in there for the
winter. I hope you freshies will like vegetables, because
you&rsquo;re going to get plenty of them here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what in the world is the matter with the swimming
pool that they have to store vegetables in it?&rdquo;
asked Sim as they walked down a gloomy corridor.</p>
<p>Arden felt her heart sinking. She dared not look
at Sim.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>isn&rsquo;t</i> the matter with it?&rdquo; sneered Miss
Everett. &ldquo;The pump is broken, the concrete walls are
full of cracks, the tile bottom is broken in several
places so that it won&rsquo;t hold water, and half the edge is
gone on one side. It hasn&rsquo;t been kept in service for
two years, I imagine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Sim sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No money. The depression&mdash;and other things, I
suppose,&rdquo; answered the blonde guide. &ldquo;And then, too,
nobody here, that I know, goes in much for swimming.
It isn&rsquo;t my line, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arden ventured to glance at Sim, who at that moment
raised her eyebrows with rather a breathless
gesture and pushed her smart sport hat back on her
head. But Sim did not further pursue the matter then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the recreation hall for your floor.&rdquo; Miss
Everett indicated a large bare room, the broad doors
of which were partly open. &ldquo;And down this way,&rdquo; she
went on, &ldquo;is your room. You&rsquo;re free to do what you
like until you hear the bell, and then you&rsquo;re to report
in the hall. Hazing,&rdquo; she added ominously, &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t
begin until next week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for bringing us up here,&rdquo; the three
chorused as they turned toward No. 513. But the tired
sophomore had already vanished down the dusky corridor.</p>
<p>For a few moments Arden, Sim, and Terry were
too bewildered to speak as they entered their room.
Silently they noted that their bags were already there.
Tom must have ridden up with them on some sort of
an elevator to arrive ahead of the girls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>It was a long narrow room with three beds in a
row, two on one side of the door and one on the other.
There were three bureaus against the opposite wall,
and there were three windows, close together, at one
end of the apartment. A most attractive and home-like
feature was a window seat extending beneath the
three casements. Three desks and a small bookcase
completed the furnishings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness, there&rsquo;s a large closet for our
clothes!&rdquo; exclaimed Sim, opening the door to disclose
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s lovely here,&rdquo; murmured Terry.</p>
<p>Arden went to the windows and looked out through
the gathering dusk. She saw down below, and a far
distance it seemed, the cinder circle of the drive with
a fountain in the center. On a little plot of grass was
the stone deer gazing, in a surprised manner, Arden
thought, across the campus toward the railroad tracks.</p>
<p>Somewhere to the south of Pentville&mdash;and home&mdash;for
all three freshmen. Just about this time the
lights were being turned on. The respective fathers
would be shaking out their evening papers and the respective
mothers would be seeing to it that the dinners
weren&rsquo;t late.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>With a start Arden turned away from the windows.
She wasn&rsquo;t getting homesick, was she, so soon? She
who had urged the others to come to Cedar Ridge! A
typical freshman trick!</p>
<p>But no! Sim and Terry seemed all right. Terry was
combing her sandy hair, and Sim was rummaging in
her suitcase.</p>
<p>Not the prettiest of the three, Sim Westover had
something about her that left a clear impression which
could be remembered afterward. Her eyes, large and
sparkling, were sea-gray in color, with long, dark-brown
lashes. It was fitting that Sim&rsquo;s eyes should,
somehow, be of a sea tint, for since she was a little
girl she had spent all her summers at the shore, and
she reveled in surf-bathing and swimming in deep
water. Sim made no secret of the fact that some day
she was going to be a champion swimmer and diver.
That, perhaps, was why she had so readily agreed to
Arden&rsquo;s proposal to come to Cedar Ridge when she
saw the picture of the swimming pool in the prospectus.
And that was why Sim was going to be so bitterly
disappointed because the pool was out of use. A
storage place for vegetables.</p>
<p>Poor Sim!</p>
<p>Terry considered herself the luckiest in her family,
for all her sisters had straw-colored brows and lashes
that are often seen with reddish hair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>Tall and muscular was Terry, and she had fine eyes
with brown lashes and brows. She played tennis and
golf, rode, and was a good swimmer, though, as she
admitted, not as &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; about it as was Sim. Sim was
different. She was small, light-haired, and round of
face. She was afraid that some day she would be fat.
Perhaps that was why she paid so much attention to
water sports.</p>
<p>Arden smoothed her dark, softly curling hair,
turned her blue eyes away from the window view that
was fast being obscured by the darkness outside, and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Choose whichever beds you girls want. I&rsquo;ll take
the one you leave. And about the pool&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the pool!&rdquo; interrupted Sim. &ldquo;I came here
because of that, and now it might as well not be here.
I thought it was queer they&rsquo;d leave a wheelbarrow at
the entrance. It couldn&rsquo;t be used in first-aid rescues; I
knew that!&rdquo; She was almost sneering now, like Miss
Everett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but Sim!&rdquo; burst out Arden. &ldquo;The pool will be
fixed. They&rsquo;ve just got to fix it! We&rsquo;ll have it repaired.
If it&rsquo;s a little money they need, we&rsquo;ll get that, somehow.
If you two will help&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we&rsquo;ll help,&rdquo; Terry was quick to offer.
&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll never get the money! How can you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Terry, but there&rsquo;ll be a way, I&rsquo;m
sure.&rdquo; With a gayety she did not feel, Arden stood on
her large suitcase, raised one hand as though drinking
a toast, and exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the pool! May it never be a pool of tears!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my word!&rdquo; gasped Terry. &ldquo;My word, Arden
Blake! Get off that suitcase! You must be standing
right on the fruit-cake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fruit-cake!&rdquo; echoed Sim. &ldquo;Is there a fruit-cake? If
there is, Arden, get off it! For if some of the stories
the old grads tell are true, we&rsquo;ll be mighty glad to
have that fruit-cake before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get excited, my pets!&rdquo; mocked Arden,
lightly descending. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Terry&rsquo;s cake, but she didn&rsquo;t
have room for it in her bag so I packed it in mine. But
it&rsquo;s in a tin box. So you shall have your cake and also
your swimming pool, Sim, my dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smiling, Arden opened the suitcase and took out a
gold and red tin box which she set in the center of
the middle bureau. With the electrics switched on,
the red and gold box gave a high light to the room, a
fact to which Terry immediately called attention. She
added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as we can go to town we must get spreads
for the beds and covers to match for the bureaus.
And I&rsquo;ll have my globe sent up from home. I always
think a globe makes a room look as though it were
inhabited by a student. And perhaps a lamp with a
green shade. Oh, do let&rsquo;s hurry and unpack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terry was almost breathless, but her eyes were
shining and Arden, who was beginning to worry over
the responsibility she had assumed in urging her chums
to come to Cedar Ridge, felt she would not have to be
concerned for Terry, at least.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the bed nearest the door, as you know I&rsquo;m
apt to be a &lsquo;leetle-mite&rsquo; slow,&rdquo; drawled Terry. &ldquo;You
take the one nearest the window, Arden. Then you
can look up at the stars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sim laughed and said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the middle bed
so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you can be the meat in the sandwich, little
one!&rdquo; interrupted Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so little, Terry Landry! It&rsquo;s just because
you&rsquo;re such a giantess!&rdquo; declared Sim indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop teasing her, Terry! It&rsquo;ll soon be time to go
to the Hall, and we haven&rsquo;t so much as washed our
faces. Besides&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Arden could finish her speech, the sort Terry
called &ldquo;Arden&rsquo;s good-will talk,&rdquo; there sounded a loud
knock on the door.</p>
<p>Without waiting to be invited, Toots Everett, the
tall blonde guide, entered with two other girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand at attention, freshies!&rdquo; Toots loudly commanded.
&ldquo;I am Miss Everett. The girl on my right is
Miss Darglan and on my left Miss MacGovern. We
three have picked you three to haze, when the proper
time comes. I&rsquo;ll take the red-head, Jessica,&rdquo; she said
to the girl on her right.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the baby,&rdquo; decided the sophomore called
Jessica. &ldquo;That leaves the black-haired goddess for
you, Pip. Don&rsquo;t be too hard with her,&rdquo; she mocked.
&ldquo;She looks as if she had led a sheltered life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; began Sim, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do the talking,&rdquo; interrupted Miss Everett
coldly. &ldquo;You girls will report to us every day after
classes, for a while. Your time is, henceforth, our time.
We hope you have good constitutions. Our room is
416 on the floor below. See that you keep it in good
order!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my friends, look!&rdquo; suddenly exclaimed Pip
MacGovern, indicating the fruit-cake in plain sight.
&ldquo;A goodie from home that we must not overlook. It
is also to be hoped that you freshies brought a tea set
and the wherewithals to go with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; timidly admitted Terry, &ldquo;we have&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was interrupted by a surreptitious kick from
Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; declared Toots. &ldquo;I can see where you
three will be very useful to us!&rdquo; she exulted. &ldquo;Does
anyone care for a piece of cake?&rdquo; she asked her
chums. &ldquo;Sometimes our dinners here leave much to be
desired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She walked with exaggerated undulations toward
the bureau, like a model showing a new gown, removed
the red and gold cover from the box and sniffed
appreciatively. Having no knife, Toots took the cake
in both hands and was about to break it as a boy
breaks an apple when&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>Clang-clang! Clang-clang! Clang-clang! Clang-clang!
Clang-clang!</p>
<p>An insistent bell, so close to their door that it
startled the three freshmen, rang loudly. Arden, Sim,
and Terry moved closer together as if for protection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; gasped Terry. &ldquo;Fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Brighteyes,&rdquo; mocked Toots. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the five-five-five.
The bell calling us to listen, most humbly, to
Tiddy&rsquo;s welcome-home speech. Your fruit-cake is
saved, for the time being. But our time will come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon Toots, followed by her fellow hazers,
stalked out of the room, leaving Arden, Sim, and
Terry staring wonderingly after them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I think,&rdquo; murmured Terry, &ldquo;that perhaps the
bell was also meant for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Sim, &ldquo;it probably was. Well, here&rsquo;s
where we go in off the deep end!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the three freshmen hastily made ready to attend
in the recreation hall, and as the black gloom of
night settled down over Cedar Ridge College, out in
the old apple orchard a young man in blue overalls
wandered beneath the gnarled trees. He looked
toward the brightly lighted windows of the recreation
hall and then, with a quizzical smile on his bronzed
face, while he stroked his mustache, he glanced toward
the broken swimming pool and walked softly away
through the rows of fruit-laden branches.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><br />CHAPTER III
<br />Black Danger</h2>
<p>Rather timid, diffident, and certainly not as self-confident
as they had been when the sneering sophomores
had invaded their room, Arden, Terry, and Sim
stood looking at one another outside the hall. Finally
Arden broke the portentous silence by saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose we had better go in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No help for it,&rdquo; voiced Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it may not be as bad as we think,&rdquo; consoled
Terry. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like going in for a swim the first day of
the season. The first is always the worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me about dives and swimming!&rdquo;
snapped Sim. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m cheated, and I resent it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Sim!&rdquo; murmured Arden helplessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean you, my dear. It&rsquo;s just hard times
and whoever is responsible for storing vegetables in
the pool that I&rsquo;m sore against!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, come on!&rdquo; urged Terry. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get it over
with.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>With hearts momentarily beating faster, the three
stepped into the recreation hall on their floor. It was
a big room that was rapidly filling with girls, girls,
and more girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just group yourselves about, young ladies. I shall
not detain you very long,&rdquo; said Miss Tidbury Anklon,
the dean, with a half smile as she stood teetering upon
her toes on the platform at the end of the room. Miss
Anklon was a small woman, dark of complexion, and
thin. This intermittent raising of herself on her toes
as she talked seemed to be an effort to make herself
taller and more impressive. Her severity and keen
words at times, however, made her sufficiently respected
and not a little feared. She was now trying to
bring about some semblance of order in the inevitable
chaos of the first assembly of new pupils.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet, please!&rdquo; Miss Anklon tapped her knuckles
on a convenient table. &ldquo;There are a few things I must
explain to you freshmen girls on your first night in
Cedar Ridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, in spite of her promise, the dean did keep them
rather long, until Sim found herself standing first on
one foot and then on the other. Arden leaned quite
frankly on Terry, who in turn rested herself against
the nearest wall. It hadn&rsquo;t seemed worth while to sit
down at first. Now it was too late to take chairs. The
dean generalized.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>The freshmen must always &ldquo;sign in and out&rdquo; when
leaving the college grounds and returning. They would
find the registry book in the lower vestibule hall. They
might go to town, if the time of their classes would
permit. But if in going to town a class period was
missed, the offending ones would be &ldquo;campused&rdquo; for
a week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not allowed to leave the college precincts,&rdquo; Miss
Anklon took pains to translate.</p>
<p>Arden, her chums, and the others were told of the
&ldquo;honor system,&rdquo; of &ldquo;upper classmen&rdquo; and &ldquo;lower classmen,&rdquo;
and of rules and regulations, until many of the
girls began to wonder how they could possibly remember
it all.</p>
<p>One thing was deeply impressed upon them. Here,
at Cedar Ridge, they were, for the time being, freshmen.
However great had been their standing at their
local high or preparatory schools, now they were the
lowest of the low. The dean didn&rsquo;t say that in so
many words, but this was the impression she created.</p>
<p>Miss Anklon, &ldquo;Tiddy&rdquo; to the initiated, implied that
as far as instructions along those lines went, the sophomores
would not be long in making such matters clear
to the freshmen. But it was all to be taken in a sporting
manner and in the end would do much to cement
friendships and foster school spirit, smiled Tiddy.</p>
<p>Terry was busy looking about the room, selecting
girls who, she thought, looked like her friends at
home. Arden was wondering what Sim was going to
do now that there was no pool, and Sim, while also
looking about, was debating with herself just how
much the loss of the swimming she had counted on was
going to mean to her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>Arden Blake, Theodosia (Terry) Landry and Bernice
(Sim) Westover had been chums through their
primary, grammar, and Vincent Prep days. Their
friendships began very early, when all three, living
near one another in the small city of Pentville, found
themselves in the same class. Their association was
further cemented when all three graduated at the same
time from Vincent, which was an unofficial &ldquo;feeder&rdquo;
for Cedar Ridge College.</p>
<p>Addison Blake, the father of Arden, was a prosperous
automobile dealer in Pentville. Terry was the
daughter of Mrs. Nelson Landry, a widow with a
fairly good income even through the depression. Sim
had for her parents Mr. and Mrs. Benson Westover.
Mr. Westover owned a large department store, with
branches in several cities. Mr. Westover had wanted
a boy and his wife a girl, when the daughter was born,
and Sim&rsquo;s nickname was a combination of She and
Him. It fitted her perfectly. She was clever and
popular in the trio and outside of it, more especially
as she was in a position to obtain from the grocery department
in her father&rsquo;s store many good things to
eat&mdash;food more or less forbidden at surreptitious
school feasts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Mary Todd,&rdquo; whispered Arden as the talk
of the dean was obviously drawing to a close.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and Ethel Anderson and Jane Randall,&rdquo;
added Sim.</p>
<p>These were three other girls from Vincent, but they
lived in a New York suburb. They were friends with
but not exactly chums of Arden and her two close
companions. They had not made up their minds to
come to Cedar Ridge until after the three inseparables
had made their announcement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, my dear young ladies,&rdquo; Miss Anklon finally
concluded, &ldquo;you will go to the dining room and be assigned
your tables for the term.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly a flood of conversation was loosed. Arden
and Sim clung together, and Terry, who had been momentarily
separated from them, pushed her way
through a throng of strange girls to reach her two
friends.</p>
<p>Dean Anklon led the way, and all the freshmen followed
down the five dark flights of stairs to the large
dining room that was brilliantly lighted. At the door
the dean was called aside by one of the teachers, and
the bewildered freshies, swarming in, were left huddled
together like a troop of new soldiers whose commander
had deserted them.</p>
<p>Terry, at this point, took matters into her own
hands, and, motioning to her chums to follow, selected
a chair at a pleasant table about halfway down the
length of the dining room and near a window. Some
other freshies followed the lead of the more bold
three, and the chairs were all quickly filled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>Terry looked at Arden, obviously well pleased with
herself at so soon having become a class leader. Her
joy was short-lived, however. A none too gentle tap
on her shoulder caused her to look up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You freshies! What do you mean by sitting at our
table?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Toots Everett, with Jessica Darglan and
Priscilla MacGovern standing behind her. All were
glaring at the offending freshmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty good start, I must say!&rdquo; sneered Jessica.
&ldquo;Your table is down there!&rdquo; Dramatically she pointed
to the far-distant lower end of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go down there,&rdquo; Priscilla said a little more gently.
&ldquo;You know you freshmen will have to think, now that
you are in college. I&rsquo;m afraid this means, for you
three, the picking of lots of apples.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without a word, but deeply humiliated, the freshmen
all rose and followed the lead of Terry, Arden,
and Sim to their own proper table. Other freshmen,
who had not made this social error, as well as the assembled
sophomores, juniors and seniors, looked on,
smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did she mean&mdash;picking a lot of apples?&rdquo;
whispered Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I know?&rdquo; gasped Sim. &ldquo;Oh, is my face
red!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>The three and the other freshmen quickly seated
themselves in the proper chairs, and a chatter of conversation,
more or less coherent, began. Most of the
girls were strangers among strangers, but, realizing
that they were all under the same roof and would be
for some time to come, they soon began talking together,
introducing themselves and a friendly spirit
was quickly engendered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Arden! What a dreadful thing to do!&rdquo; gasped
Terry. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you know I&rsquo;d start something like
that!&rdquo; She was greatly embarrassed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Terry,&rdquo; soothed Arden. &ldquo;If only,
though, it didn&rsquo;t have to be our own particular sophomores
whose seats we took.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our fruit-cake hasn&rsquo;t a chance now, and I&rsquo;m
afraid we shall be really well hazed,&rdquo; said Sim as she
looked sadly at Terry. Then she glanced down at her
plate, adding: &ldquo;This cold ham with sliced tomatoes
doesn&rsquo;t help to raise my spirits any. Poor fruit-cake!
Not a chance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it has a chance, Sim!&rdquo; excitedly whispered
Terry. &ldquo;I have an idea! If that fruit-cake is to be
eaten we had best do it ourselves. There are twelve
of us at this table. I&rsquo;m afraid it doesn&rsquo;t mean much
cake each, but we must stick together in times like
these.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Terry? What are you going to do?&rdquo;
Sim wanted to know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, just listen, and you&rsquo;ll find out.&rdquo; Getting the
attention of the other girls at the table, Terry continued
in a tragic whisper: &ldquo;As soon as you can, after
we three leave, all of you here come to our room. It&rsquo;s
513.&rdquo; She indicated Arden and Sim with herself.
&ldquo;Knock twice, a pause&mdash;another knock. Those sophs
will never taste that fruit-cake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a grand idea!&rdquo; declared Arden.</p>
<p>After this, amid bubbling talk, the meal was quickly
finished. The students began filing out of the dining
hall. Old friends greeted one another with open arms
and in a surprisingly short time most of the talking,
laughing groups had disappeared into various rooms
where, behind closed doors, they still talked and talked
and talked.</p>
<p>Arden, Sim, and Terry hurried to 513 to get it
ready for visitors. It was not long before the first
&ldquo;tap-tap&mdash;tap,&rdquo; sounded and the first visitors were
admitted. Others followed until the window seat and
the beds, to say nothing of the chairs, were all much
sat upon until, as Sim whispered to Arden, it was
almost necessary to put out a sign of S. R. O.</p>
<p>The fruit-cake was brought out from hiding, was
much admired, and then went the way of all good
fruit-cakes; a nail file being used to cut it into slices,
and handkerchiefs serving as plates.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>In the intervals of eating, the girls found out much
about one another and vowed to stick together during
the hazing, the prospects of which had really frightened
some. Voices rose hilariously higher and higher,
and laughter became more frequent. They were having
a fine time. It was good to be thus sitting around
in a college room, talking to interesting girls, thought
Arden and her two chums, and planning future fun.
Studies were momentarily pushed into the mental background.</p>
<p>Now and again someone would inquire about
&ldquo;math&rdquo; or &ldquo;English lit.&rdquo; Girls whose older sisters had
been to Cedar Ridge before them were somewhat well
informed as to which of the instructors were &ldquo;easy&rdquo;
and those for whom students must really make adequate
preparation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t worry much about English lit, though,&rdquo;
Arden remarked, brushing crumbs from her lap. &ldquo;But
math I&rsquo;ll never get through. I just can&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Math is easy for me,&rdquo; declared Mary Todd, a
really lovely-looking girl, wearing a simple, well-cut
sports dress of the &ldquo;shirtmaker&rdquo; type. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you,
Arden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks a lot, Mary,&rdquo; Arden responded gratefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to study hard for everything,&rdquo; lamented
Sim. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a bit clever that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; began Terry, &ldquo;I think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>But she never had a chance to say what she thought.
Suddenly, before any of the convivial little party
realized what was happening, the door of 513 was
pushed open and the &ldquo;Terrible Three,&rdquo; as Arden
later nicknamed them, stood within the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? Freshmen meeting in your room,
Miss Blake!&rdquo; Toots Everett was very stern. &ldquo;You
girls who don&rsquo;t belong here will go at once to your
own rooms and don&rsquo;t do any more of this visiting.
Jessica, confiscate the fruit-cake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jessica made a noble attempt, but there was no
fruit-cake. The red and gold box was empty. All that
remained were a few crumbs for the mice. Arden
smiled sweetly at Pips MacGovern, Terry was grinning
most enjoyably, and Sim&rsquo;s round eyes outdid
themselves in roundness.</p>
<p>The offending freshmen quickly vanished to their
own rooms, while the three sophomores were speechless
with indignation. Toots finally found her voice to
say frostily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the third time we have met, Miss Westover,
Miss Blake and Miss Landry. This meeting is
somewhat to your advantage. But we sophomores
will not forget. You three will report to me, Miss
Everett, in my room tomorrow after classes. The
program has been changed. Hazing will begin officially
tomorrow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Waiting an ominous moment to see if the threatening
words had any actual effect, the three sophomores
then silently left the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s that!&rdquo; remarked Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t she dreadful!&rdquo; murmured Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be fun, girls!&rdquo; Arden exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not a bit afraid of being hazed. Now, let&rsquo;s unpack the
rest of our things, and then we must write some letters
home. They will all be so anxious to know what happened
on our first day at Cedar Ridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a lot has happened,&rdquo; murmured Sim, looking
doubtful. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we haven&rsquo;t exactly endeared
ourselves to those sophs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who cares?&rdquo; laughed Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After hazing is over they&rsquo;ll be our good friends,&rdquo;
declared Arden. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s part of their stock in trade to
seem very gruff and terrible now, but we needn&rsquo;t
worry about that. Let&rsquo;s get at our letters. You&rsquo;ll have
to lend me something to write on, Sim. I don&rsquo;t seem to
have any paper in my suitcase. There&rsquo;s some in my
trunk. I suppose that&rsquo;ll be up tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expected this, Arden,&rdquo; Sim laughed. &ldquo;I brought
some extra stationery for you. See that you write your
mother a nice long letter. No more ten-word telegrams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The room was soon quiet except for the scratching
of pens on paper. It was very serene around Cedar
Ridge College now, and quiet in the farm and orchard
grounds that formed part of the old estate which had
been transformed into a seat of learning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>The girls had been told that night letters might be
placed on a table at the end of their corridor, whence
they would be taken up by one of the porters or
janitors in time for the early morning mail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve finished!&rdquo; said Terry, sealing her last
envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So have I,&rdquo; said Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take them out and leave them on the table,&rdquo;
suggested Sim. &ldquo;The folks will get them tomorrow
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the three walked down the dimly lighted corridor,
they saw two other freshmen going back to
their room after having deposited their mail on the
table over which glowed a small light.</p>
<p>This table was at the end of the corridor nearest
the old apple orchard, which formed part of the college
farm. The girls had heard something of the
college farm, and there had been a veiled threat that
the freshmen had to gather apples for their sophomore
hazers.</p>
<p>The big window in the corridor was open. And as
Arden and her two chums dropped their letters upon
the table they thrust their heads out for a breath of
the fresh night air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what sort of apples grow in that
orchard?&rdquo; mused Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must be very choice,&rdquo; suggested Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; asked Terry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember, that good-looking porter
with the cute little mustache who took up our bags,
was gazing so soulfully out of the window into this
same orchard?&rdquo; suggested Arden. &ldquo;There was such a
queer, rapt look on his face, I&rsquo;m sure, though I could
see only the back of his head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my word!&rdquo; mocked Sim. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we getting
poetical and humorous all of a sudden!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; cautioned Terry in a whisper.</p>
<p>From the dark orchard below them and to the
northeast of the college building sounded a cry of
alarm and fright floating through the murky blackness.
It was a cry as if someone was in danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; gasped Sim. &ldquo;Whatever was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, with one accord, she and her chums ran back
to their room and closed the door but did not lock it.
For it was against the rules of Cedar Ridge to lock
bedroom doors. Miss Anklon had impressed this on
the freshmen. Terry, however, insisted on dragging
a chair against the portal, bracing the back of it
under the knob so it would be difficult to gain access.</p>
<p>The three girls gazed at one another with fear in
their eyes.</p>
<p>Was there danger abroad in the blackness of the
night?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><br />CHAPTER IV
<br />The Reward Circular</h2>
<p>&ldquo;What could that have been?&rdquo; gasped Terry, sinking
on her bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you heard it, too?&rdquo; asked Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course! We all heard it!&rdquo; declared Sim. &ldquo;A
shout or groan in that dark orchard as if someone
were suffering. Do you think there could have been a
fight among the help? You know they have a resident
farmer here at Cedar Ridge and several laborers.
They might have had a bout&mdash;or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly all three burst out laughing. They couldn&rsquo;t
help it. The looks on their faces were so queerly tragic.
And Terry said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re making a lot out of nothing. Probably
what happened was that a porter&mdash;the blue-eyed
porter&mdash;was trying to lug in some faculty baggage the
back way and it fell on his toes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, whatever it was, don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s go spreading
scandal around the college so early in the term,&rdquo;
warned Arden. &ldquo;We must keep the secret of the
orchard to ourselves&mdash;if there is a secret.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Guess we&rsquo;ll have to,&rdquo; yawned Sim. &ldquo;For who
knows what the secret is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That taxi-man seemed to hint at something,&rdquo; murmured
Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;bosh!&rdquo; exploded Arden. &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;re all
just worked up and nervous because this is our first
night and we&rsquo;ve had to stand a lot of annoyance so
soon&mdash;those sophs and all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well spoken, my brave girl!&rdquo; declaimed Sim.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was this thought which gradually quieted the palpitating
hearts and the excited breathing of the three.
After they had listened, more or less cowering on their
beds, and heard no sounds of any general alarm, they
finally prepared to retire for their first night at Cedar
Ridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; said Terry, &ldquo;it may have been some
skylarking boys trying to steal the college apples.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; agreed Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t sound like boys to me,&rdquo; declared Arden.
&ldquo;It was more like a man&rsquo;s shout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we don&rsquo;t need to worry about it,&rdquo; went on
Terry. &ldquo;But if those snobby sophs think we&rsquo;re going in
that orchard in the dark, after what we just heard, to
get apples for them, they can have my resignation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And mine!&rdquo; echoed her chums.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>Sleep was actually in prospect, and final yawns
had been stifled when a scratching in one corner of the
room aroused the tired girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must get a trap for those mice,&rdquo; Terry sleepily
murmured. &ldquo;I suppose they smell the fruit-cake
crumbs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All very well to trap &rsquo;em,&rdquo; chuckled Sim, &ldquo;but
who&rsquo;s going to take &rsquo;em out of the trap after they&rsquo;re
caught or strangled to death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, stop!&rdquo; pleaded Arden. &ldquo;Let the poor mice
have the crumbs. Maybe they need them.&rdquo; Which
seemed sound advice well given.</p>
<p>The morning of a new day dawned bright and cool.
Fall had only lately checked the glories of summer,
and the heavily clumped shrubbery about the college
seemed strong enough to withstand many wintry blasts
before giving up its well-earned beauty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, look, girls!&rdquo; exclaimed Arden, first of the trio
out in the corridor ready for breakfast. She pointed
a slim finger, well manicured, at the table near the end
of the passage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Sim. &ldquo;Has the orchard noise of last
night materialized?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. But they didn&rsquo;t collect our letters for the
mail,&rdquo; said Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something must be wrong with the system,&rdquo; spoke
Sim. &ldquo;Though it isn&rsquo;t to be wondered at, in the confusion
of opening night. But can&rsquo;t we take them ourselves
and drop them into the post office after breakfast?
The office is just off the college grounds across
the railroad tracks. Can&rsquo;t we do that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why not,&rdquo; reasoned Arden.</p>
<p>Breakfast was rather a cold and grim meal compared
to the excitement of the supper the night before.
It was finally eaten, however, and then, it being too
early for any classes yet and no orders having been
issued about chapel attendance, the three from room
513 started for the little post office outside the college
grounds.</p>
<p>Arden looked completely happy. Surroundings were
so important to her. Wearing a light wool dress, dull
blue in color and with most comfortable walking shoes
on, she urged her chums forward. All of the girls were
simply dressed. In keeping with the traditions at Cedar
Ridge, hats gave place to mortar-boards and, even in
freezing weather, they would be donned with a gay
defiance of winter winds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, girls!&rdquo; Arden was excited. &ldquo;I must be at
Bordmust Hall at nine. My adviser is going to help
me arrange my schedule of classes. I hope we can get
together at least on a few.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all have to be there,&rdquo; said Terry, adding with
a sigh: &ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;ll have an eight-thirty class every
day, worse luck!&rdquo; Morning sleep was so good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, swimming pool!&rdquo; chanted Sim as they passed
the building now turned to so base a use as that of a
vegetable cellar. &ldquo;When first I saw thee&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have patience!&rdquo; interrupted Arden. &ldquo;Look who&rsquo;s
coming this way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A white-haired old gentleman, clad somberly in
black, was slowly approaching along the path that led
from the front campus down to the railroad tracks and
across to the post office. His hands were clasped behind
his back and, with head bent down, he seemed
to observe only the ground at his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; whispered Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must be Rev. Henry Bordmust, the resident
chaplain here. Shall we speak&mdash;or just bow respectfully?&rdquo;
Terry looked to Arden for advice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he even sees us. He looks as though
he were thinking deeply. Let&rsquo;s wait and see if he
speaks to us.&rdquo; After this advice, Arden stepped a little
in advance of her two chums to invite the clergyman&rsquo;s
attention.</p>
<p>The daydreaming chaplain had met and was passing
the girls now; still without a sign of recognition.
But he was saying something&mdash;muttering to himself
as old men often do. The girls overheard a few words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, dear! The orchard! The old orchard!&rdquo; he
murmured. Mentally he seemed to be wringing his
hands in real distress. &ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t he come out of
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rev. Henry Bordmust sighed and passed the freshmen,
his eyes still on the path at his feet, as oblivious
of the trio as if it did not exist.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear that?&rdquo; mumbled Terry as they
walked on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was talking about the orchard&mdash;where we
heard the noise last night,&rdquo; spoke Sim. &ldquo;What can
he mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard one of the seniors talking about him,&rdquo; volunteered
Arden. &ldquo;He is said to be&mdash;queer&mdash;says things
no one can understand. And he often gives the girls
awful scoldings over nothing&mdash;and sometimes asks you
in to have tea with him, most unexpectedly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I wish he&rsquo;d invite us in to tea this afternoon,&rdquo;
murmured Sim with new energy. &ldquo;And I wish
he&rsquo;d explain what he means about someone coming out
of the orchard. I hope that weird noise doesn&rsquo;t play
any tricks tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, perhaps we misunderstood him,&rdquo; suggested
Terry. &ldquo;The chaplain can&rsquo;t know anything about a
mysterious noise in our college apple orchard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly,&rdquo; agreed Sim. &ldquo;Well, he certainly never
saw us. I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;d like to have tea with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I think he looks sweet,&rdquo; declared Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you won&rsquo;t need sugar in your tea,&rdquo; laughed
Terry. &ldquo;But let&rsquo;s hurry and mail these letters. It would
never do to be late for our first class.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>They had reached the tracks of the Delawanna
Railroad, the line that ran from New York to Morrisville,
the small city nearest the college. From force of
habit the girls stopped and looked up and down the
rails for the possible approach of a train. Soon they
would know when each one was expected. It was a
tradition that by the time one was a senior at Cedar
Ridge no watch was necessary, so familiar did the
students become with the passage of the trains.</p>
<p>The post office was a small one-roomed building
with a stove in the center. Two windows, one for the
sale of stamps and the other for the mailing of parcels,
broke the stretch of tiers of glass-fronted boxes behind
which the business was carried on. For the post office
served the town as well as the college.</p>
<p>The side walls were literally papered with police
posters offering rewards for the arrest, or information
leading to the arrest or apprehension, of various persons&mdash;criminals&mdash;men
and women. The posters were
from the police departments of several cities, New
York among them. Many of the placards were adorned
with profiles and front views of the oddest faces the
girls had ever seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, for the love of stamps!&rdquo; gasped Arden when
they had dropped their letters in the slot and were
looking at the posters. &ldquo;What nightmares!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they awful!&rdquo; agreed Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a good-looking man among them,&rdquo; was Sim&rsquo;s
opinion. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard about these posters. They&rsquo;ve been
here, some of them, for I don&rsquo;t know how long. It&rsquo;s a
sort of a game among the girls to see who can find the
funniest face.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try it,&rdquo; suggested Arden, laughing. Suddenly
she ceased her mirth and stood as if fascinated in
front of a poster showing the full-face picture of a
young man. He was rather good-looking and quite an
exception to the other portraits so publicly displayed.
His face, like most of the others, was smooth, unadorned
by beard or mustache.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terry!&rdquo; impulsively exclaimed Arden. &ldquo;Look!
Haven&rsquo;t you seen that face before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terry considered carefully before slowly answering:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t believe I have. It isn&rsquo;t a bad face,
though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather interesting,&rdquo; agreed Sim. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s he
wanted for, murder or bank robbery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither,&rdquo; answered Arden. &ldquo;Listen.&rdquo; She read
from the poster:</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thousand dollars reward for information as to
the whereabouts of Harry Pangborn.&rdquo; Then followed
a general description, the age being given as twenty-three,
and there was added the statement that the
young man had suddenly disappeared from his home
on the estate of his grandfather, Remington Pangborn,
on Long Island.</p>
<p>Part of the poster consisted of a statement from
the attorneys of Remington Pangborn&mdash;the <i>late</i> Mr.
Pangborn, it was made plain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Harry Pangborn,&rdquo; the statement read, &ldquo;is not
wanted on any criminal charge whatever. He disappeared
from his friends and his usual haunts merely,
it is surmised, because he was expected to assume the
duties and responsibilities of the large estate he was
about to inherit from his grandfather. It is understood
that he stated he did not want the inheritance just yet.
Of a high-strung and nervous temperament, Mr. Pangborn
is believed to have gone away because the responsibilities
of wealth are distasteful to him and
also, perhaps, because he seeks adventure, of which he
is very fond. If this meets his eye or if anyone can
convey to him the information that he will be permitted
to assume as much or as little of the estate as
he wishes, a great service will have been done. All
that is desired is that Harry Pangborn will return to
his friends and relatives as soon as possible. His
hasty action will be overlooked. It is rumored that Mr.
Pangborn may be in the vicinity of Morrisville, though
he may have gone abroad, as he was fond of foreign
travel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Information and claims for the above reward may
be sent to Riker &amp; Tabcorn, Attorneys, New York
City, or to the local police department in the municipality
where this poster is displayed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls, crowding about Arden, read the poster
with her. Then Sim said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was in the movies that you saw someone
who reminds you of him, Arden. Harry Pangborn isn&rsquo;t
bad looking, compared to all the others.&rdquo; With a
sweeping gesture she indicated the various poster
exhibits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s positively handsome when you put him
alongside of Dead-eye Dick, here,&rdquo; laughed Terry.
&ldquo;As for Two-gun Bobbie&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m serious, girls,&rdquo; interrupted Arden. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure
I&rsquo;ve seen this young man somewhere before. Now, if
we could only locate him or tell the lawyers where to
look for him and get this reward money, wouldn&rsquo;t it
be just wonderful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grand!&rdquo; agreed Terry. &ldquo;But wake up, my dear.
You&rsquo;re dreaming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve just thought of something else!&rdquo; went on
Arden, oblivious of the banter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we did collect this money we could donate it to
the college to have the swimming pool repaired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s sweet of you and a good idea, Arden, but I
don&rsquo;t believe we could do it,&rdquo; objected Sim. &ldquo;Besides,
I don&rsquo;t exactly believe what it says on this poster. It
seems very silly for a young fellow to disappear just
when he&rsquo;s coming into a lot of money&mdash;a fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he was made to disappear,&rdquo; suggested
Terry, her eyes opening wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! You mean&mdash;kidnaped?&rdquo; asked Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worse and more of it!&rdquo; laughed Sim.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyhow, we could try, couldn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; Arden
asked. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d help, wouldn&rsquo;t you, Terry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed I&rsquo;ll help. I&rsquo;ve always fancied myself in
the r&ocirc;le of a detective, spouting pithy Chinese philosophy
and generally getting underfoot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Terry, just be serious for once. And Sim,
you also. You know how disappointed you were when
you found out the swimming pool was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Kapoot!</i>&rdquo; chuckled Sim, supplying Arden&rsquo;s evident
lack of a word with the latest Russian expression. &ldquo;Go
on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; resumed Arden, pouting a little, &ldquo;you never
can tell. Maybe we could do it. It isn&rsquo;t impossible.
Stranger things have happened. And I just know I&rsquo;ve
seen that young man on the poster somewhere before.
If I could only remember where! Did either of you
ever have that feeling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lots of times. I&rsquo;m for you, Arden!&rdquo; declared Sim.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do what I can and whatever you say. This mysterious
Harry Pangborn may very well be right around
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Around Cedar Ridge!&rdquo; shrilled Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly! Why not? If the authorities didn&rsquo;t think
it likely that he might be in this vicinity, why did they
put the poster up here in the post office? And they
mentioned Morrisville,&rdquo; challenged Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something in that,&rdquo; Terry admitted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if he should be in hiding around here and we
could find him and claim the thousand dollars reward,&rdquo;
breathed Arden, &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t it be just wonderful!
And what a sensation when we magnanimously
turned the money over to the college for the swimming
pool. Oh, oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you do that for dear old Alma Mater when
you don&rsquo;t know her so very well?&rdquo; asked Sim, who,
with her chums, was still gazing at the poster of the
good-looking but missing heir of the Pangborn estate
of millions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d do it for you, Sim, dear,&rdquo; murmured Arden.
&ldquo;I want you to be happy here, since I teased you so
to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you think I won&rsquo;t be happy without the swimming
pool?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as happy as I would be with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But even admitting that this missing young man
may be around here,&rdquo; suggested Terry, &ldquo;what chance
have we of finding him? We have so much college
work to do. For, after all, we were sent here to learn
something,&rdquo; she sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Granted,&rdquo; laughed Arden. &ldquo;But we may find time
for a little detective work on the side as well as for
hazing. Oh, it&rsquo;s a wonderful prospect!&rdquo; She swung
around in a few dance steps right there in the old post
office.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;d better be getting back,&rdquo; suggested Sim
after this. &ldquo;Oh, look at the clock!&rdquo; she gasped. Then
followed a hurried sending of some picture postcards
they had bought; cards on which they marked with an
X the location of their room.</p>
<p>The three chums were bubbling with life, laughter,
and merriment as they turned to leave the little building,
but their mirth was turned to alarm as a stern
voice assailed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young ladies!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They looked around to see Rev. Dr. Henry Bordmust
sternly regarding them from the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dr. Bordmust,&rdquo; Sim almost whispered as the
chaplain appeared to be waiting for formal recognition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are freshmen!&rdquo; he accused, with a glance at
their mortarboards, the tassels of which told the tale.
&ldquo;You know you are not permitted over here&mdash;in the
post office. It is against the college rules&mdash;for you
freshmen. Return at once! You must! You must!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He appeared strangely stirred and angry, and his
dark brows, shading his bright little eyes, bent into a
frown. But somehow, after that first booming and
accusative &ldquo;young ladies,&rdquo; the chaplain seemed exhausted,
as though the anger pent up in him had taken
something from his none too profuse vitality. He was
an old man. Now he essayed a wintry smile and added,
as he gently waved them out with motions of his thin
white hands:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is to say, you shouldn&rsquo;t have come here. You&mdash;er&mdash;have
no need to be&mdash;er&mdash;frightened at this first
infraction of the rules, but&mdash;er&mdash;another time you
may be&mdash;er&mdash;campused for such action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, having seen that the three were on their way
out, Dr. Bordmust turned to the window, evidently
to buy some stamps for the letters he held in one
hand. He murmured to himself in those queer, quavering,
meaningless tones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad; too bad! I can&rsquo;t always be watching!
Dear me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wonderingly, Arden and her chums looked at the
shrinking figure in black as they passed out of the
door. But Dr. Bordmust gave them no further attention.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><br />CHAPTER V
<br />Rescued</h2>
<p>Sim, who was hurrying after Arden and Terry up
the steep hill on top of which was perched Bordmust
Hall, uttered a series of frightened exclamations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oo-oo-oo! Oh, my! Oh, but I was frightened.
Wasn&rsquo;t he angry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since Dr. Bordmust is our chaplain, it was probably
what might be called righteous anger,&rdquo; suggested
Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose he meant when he spoke
about not always watching?&rdquo; asked Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Arden had to admit. &ldquo;The girls say
Dr. Bordmust is really queer at times. I suppose it is
because he&rsquo;s such a profound student. He knows such
a lot, all about Egypt, so many languages, and they say
ancient history is an open book to him.&rdquo; Arden was
fairly sprinting along the boardwalk that made the
steep path up to Bordmust Hall a little easier. What
with talking and hurrying, her breath was a bit gaspy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t ask me what it all means,&rdquo; begged
Terry. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t even guess. But, oh! I do hope I&rsquo;m
not going to be late for this first class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So say we all of us,&rdquo; chanted Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t be too severe at the very beginning,&rdquo;
murmured Arden.</p>
<p>Bordmust Hall, where most of the class sessions
were held, crowned with its classic architecture the
summit of the long slope which formed the eminence
of the broad acres about Cedar Ridge College. It was
behind the main, or dormitory, building in which
were housed the executive offices and the residence
rooms of the faculty. To the southwest of the hall,
and easily viewed from the steps, was the unused pool.
To the northwest, and in line with the main building,
was the beautiful Gothic chapel with its wonderful
stained-glass windows. Near the chapel was the unimposing
home of the chaplain, Rev. Dr. Bordmust; one
of whose ancestors had partly endowed Cedar Ridge.
For this reason the hall was named for him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>At the foot of the slope on which the hall stood
were the rambling fields and gardens where much of
the farm produce for the college tables was raised.
The nearest of the farm-lands, so called, was the
orchard, part of which could be seen from the southeast
windows of the dormitory. And it was this orchard
that the taxi-man had indicated in such a warning
manner. It was this orchard into which Tom Scott,
the good-looking porter, had been staring the night
of the arrival of Arden Blake and her chums. So much
had been crowded into the comparatively short time
the three freshmen had been at college that they had
almost forgotten the strange orchard. Even now they
had no chance to consider the matter, for they, with
many other girls, were hastening to their first classes.</p>
<p>They gave a momentary glance toward the orchard,
with its quaint gnarled trees. The morning sun was
glinting on red, dark-green, and golden russet apples
which the gardener and his men had not yet started
to gather.</p>
<p>Arden, especially, gazed searchingly at the orchard.
Apple trees grow in such strange shapes and huddle
so closely to themselves, as if each one guarded a
secret. There was a puzzled look in Arden&rsquo;s blue eyes
as she tried to guess what might be hidden by those
trees and the tall hedge surrounding them.</p>
<p>Sim was gazing rather sorrowfully at the pool
building, but Terry was smiling, perhaps because
everything seemed, for the moment, at least, to be so
filled with good and pleasant life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on in, kids!&rdquo; Sim urged her two chums. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
be along in a minute or two. I just want to take a look
at&mdash;I just want to&mdash;oh, well, go on. Don&rsquo;t wait for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But won&rsquo;t you be late?&rdquo; objected Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I have some time to my credit.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>As her surprised friends watched, Sim left them and
hurried down across a stretch of smooth lawn toward
the disused swimming pool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad,&rdquo; murmured Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is?&rdquo; asked Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really think Sim feels more keenly than we realize
about the pool. But she&rsquo;s such a good sport. Look at
her! Going to view the ashes of her hopes or the collapse
of her dreams or something equally tragic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s say anything about this,&rdquo; proposed
Terry. &ldquo;If Sim cares so much, I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;d rather
not talk about this little visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arden agreed and, taking Terry&rsquo;s arm, they hurried
into the hall.</p>
<p>Sim reached the pool building and tried to get some
idea of the wreck within by peering through a window.
But the sill was too high to afford a view, even if the
window had not been made of heavily frosted glass,
quite opaque.</p>
<p>Then she stepped back and gazed up at the copper
and glass domed roof. Around the top of the building
were set at intervals glazed tiles depicting nautical
scenes. Dolphins were diving merrily as if to tantalize
sea horses with necks proudly arched, and mermaids
flicked their tails disdainfully at Father Neptune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may as well try the door,&rdquo; Sim murmured. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
like to see what it&rsquo;s like inside, though it will probably
break my heart!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>After several hard pushes to the extent of her
strength, she succeeded in swinging back the door. She
found herself in a sort of vestibule, but the inner door
of this opened easily, and then Sim stood almost on the
edge of the abandoned pool.</p>
<p>A peculiar smell assailed her, as of a place long shut
up, but at the same time it had something of out-of-doors
about it, the odor of clean earth and ripe vegetables.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t as bad as Toots said,&rdquo; mused Sim. &ldquo;At
least, it looks as though there isn&rsquo;t so very much the
matter. It isn&rsquo;t filled with vegetables, either; just a few
bags as yet, though they probably will bring in more
when they pick the apples. This must have been a
beautiful pool once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bottom of the pool was tiled a pea green, a
color which must have given the water a most cooling
tone on a hot day. But the white tile sides no longer
gleamed, and in more than one place jagged dark
cracks ran crazily down the walls like streaks of black
lightning. Sim looked at the cracked tile and concrete
edge at her feet. The depth was still indicated, though
there was no water in the pool&mdash;5 feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the shallow end, of course,&rdquo; Sim thought,
and she walked slowly around the edge and toward the
melancholy spring-boards to which some strips of
cocoa-fiber matting still clung.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How quiet it is in here,&rdquo; Sim murmured. &ldquo;Like a
museum after hours&mdash;or an Egyptian tomb.&rdquo; She
shivered a little, though it was warm in the natatorium.</p>
<p>In the deep end several filled burlap bags were piled
up, and in each corner were barrels of cabbages leaning
against the walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought, from what Toots said, the whole place
would be filled to the brim with cabbages and turnips,&rdquo;
Sim said to herself, smiling a little ruefully. &ldquo;I wonder
how long this pool is, or should I say <i>was</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She began to measure the length with her eyes,
mentally swimming with long, smooth strokes while
her feet churned up and down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About seventy-five yards long, I guess,&rdquo; she went
on. &ldquo;And about twenty-five across. A lovely size. I
could do three lengths a day here and really enjoy
it. Let&rsquo;s see how deep it is from the end of the board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She walked gingerly out on the diving plank, choosing
the center one for there were three at the deep end,
tiered at different heights. It was difficult to estimate,
without water in the pool and with the barrels and bags
of vegetables scattered about, how close the different
boards came to the surface of the filled space. Sim
decided that the plank she was standing on was the
lowest.</p>
<p>She permitted herself a little pre-diving, teetery
bounce on the very end, half fearful lest the dried
wood should crack beneath even her light weight. But
it held, and Sim gave a bolder jump.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A straight dive&mdash;cutting the water about there!&rdquo;
With her eyes Sim indicated to herself just the spot
where her finger tips should enter the water&mdash;had
there been any water there.</p>
<p>She jumped again and came down safely, with no
warning cracking of the dried plank. Then she balanced
herself on the very tip of the board before,
mentally, springing into the air. Now she performed a
most ambitious jump, but this time the stiffened wood
snapped back suddenly. Sim was thrown to one side,
and she swung her arms around and around like a child
on its first roller skates, trying desperately not to
topple backward.</p>
<p>But her motions only caused the board to quiver
more violently, and in a split second Sim slipped off
and clung, with her finger tips only, to the edge of the
plank, while the hard-tiled bottom of the pool, seemingly
miles below, waited to receive her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, gosh! What&rsquo;ll I do?&rdquo; poor Sim thought.
&ldquo;Those tiles don&rsquo;t look very soft, and I&rsquo;ll drop in a
minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her fingers ached from their stiff clinging grip, and
her arms were quickly tiring. She decided she must
soon let go for after a futile attempt to sling one leg
up over the side edge of the board it bent so alarmingly
that she feared it would snap. She began to
swing to and fro like a pendulum, hoping she might
cast herself upon a bag of vegetables which would
serve to break her fall, when, suddenly, she felt her
wrists firmly gripped by two hands, and she looked
up to see Tom Scott, the porter-gardener, smiling
down at her. He was kneeling on the end of the plank.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t jump!&rdquo; he warned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pull you up. It&rsquo;s
rather the reverse of &lsquo;don&rsquo;t shoot, I&rsquo;ll come down,&rsquo;
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he said lightly. He could not have taken
better means to quiet Sim&rsquo;s excited nerves than with
Mr. Crockett&rsquo;s little coon banter.</p>
<p>With what seemed no effort at all, Tom Scott lifted
her up and held her clear of the end of the board so
her legs did not scrape against it. Then he carefully
walked back with her toward the middle of the plank,
where there was no danger of its breaking, set her
down, and stood grinning at her. A nice grin it was,
too, Sim thought later.</p>
<p>She managed to produce a weak, embarrassed smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you so much!&rdquo; she said a bit stiffly. The man
must think her crazy. &ldquo;I&mdash;I slipped! I&mdash;er&mdash;I was&mdash;that
is, I was trying&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; To cover her confusion she
looked at her red finger tips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurt?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Broke two or three nails,&rdquo; Sim responded ruefully.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad you came along. I might have sprained
an ankle if I had let go, for this end must be nine feet
deep.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The water, when there is any, is over nine feet
deep nearest this wall,&rdquo; said Tom Scott. &ldquo;You certainly
would have been jarred a bit, to say the least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I must thank you again. But please don&rsquo;t
mention to anyone that you found me in such a silly fix,
will you?&rdquo; Sim begged. She was quickly regaining her
lost composure. &ldquo;I just wanted to get a look at the
pool and foolishly walked out on the board. I imagined
myself poising for a dive and I slipped off. You won&rsquo;t
tell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Tom agreed, somewhat gayly,
it seemed. &ldquo;I came in to get a few of the early apples
we have stored here. One of the cooks asked me to. I
imagine there are going to be pies. But, honestly, I
won&rsquo;t tell a soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Sim murmured.</p>
<p>The young gardener walked up to the middle of the
pool and with athletic ease jumped down in it near
several bags of vegetables. He picked up one containing
apples, heaved it up on the edge and jumped up
himself. Then, slinging the sack up on his shoulder, he
walked toward the door, giving Sim a friendly backward
glance as he went out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a nice young man!&rdquo; said Sim to herself. &ldquo;He
doesn&rsquo;t seem like a gardener at all. No brogue and
no accent of any kind. I wish I could tell Arden and
Terry, but I&rsquo;d rather die than have them know of
this dizzy adventure. I must have looked perfectly
stupid hanging there on the end of the plank!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>The clanging of a distant bell brought Sim back to
reality, and as she looked at her wrist watch she left
all thoughts of pools and good-looking rescuing gardeners
behind her. For it would need a swift dash to
get her to Bordmust Hall before she would be late
for her class.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><br />CHAPTER VI
<br />Apple Hazing</h2>
<p>Girls of various sizes, types, and descriptions were
hurrying into the building, and their clothes, of all
colors, gave a luster otherwise lacking in the dull,
sand-colored structure. The freshmen were easily distinguished
from the other students by the fact that
they were all carrying or scanning yellow cards which
told them in what rooms to report for their first
classes.</p>
<p>Sim was surprised to see Arden and Terry still outside
the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you had to hurry in to class,&rdquo; she said,
hoping they wouldn&rsquo;t notice her broken nails.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wrong number,&rdquo; remarked Terry. &ldquo;We went in
and were told to come back in fifteen minutes, so we
came up for air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where were you?&rdquo; asked Arden, glancing sharply
at Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;just walking around. I think I&rsquo;m about in
time for my class. Let&rsquo;s go in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>The three found they were to be separated for the
morning session though the first class in the afternoon
would find them in the same room for English literature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we must try to sit together,&rdquo; called Arden to
Sim and Terry as they parted.</p>
<p>Inside the hall all was confusion. Girls were running
hither and yon. Stairways were crowded with students
going up or coming down, and all were excited. Doors
were suddenly pushed open by uncertain freshmen and
again by oversure sophomores. The latter, in a spirit
of fun, several times sent a poor &ldquo;frosh&rdquo; up to the
top floor when she should have remained on the first.</p>
<p>Another warning bell rang and, almost at once, the
corridors were empty and quiet. Inside their classrooms
the three girls from 513 looked, listened, and
answered somewhat in a daze. That first day always
remained more or less of a hazy recollection. Something
of an organization was arranged, the roll was
checked and corrected, names were asked and given,
everyone was on edge and nervous, even the instructors.
Strange faces, many of them timid, looked on
other strange faces, also somewhat timid.</p>
<p>Then came welcome noon, and the rush out of
Bordmust and some of the other study buildings to the
dining hall was comparable only to the New York
subway rush at five o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>The afternoon classes were attended by all more
pleasantly and with less strain. To their delight,
Arden, Sim, and Terry managed to get into the same
room and sat near one another.</p>
<p>As they were leaving Bordmust Hall, at the close
of the afternoon session, Arden heard someone say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here come our three!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toots Everett, Jessica, and Pip were regarding the
other trio with sardonic smiles and, as Terry said
later, &ldquo;with murder in their eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, freshies! How about a little song
for my friends, here?&rdquo; Jessica was mockingly speaking.
&ldquo;A song befitting your talents. Arden Blake, come
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arden stepped forward, blushing. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sing,&rdquo;
she quavered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall learn. Your friend here, with the red
hair, looks like a singer. And while you two sing, Sim
Westover shall dance. On with the dance, freshies!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trio from 513 looked at one another in dismay,
but there was no help for it. Amused seniors and
juniors had gathered to see the fun. From the classmates
of Arden and her chums two kinds of advice
was forthcoming, the &ldquo;don&rsquo;t-you-do-it!&rdquo; and &ldquo;go-on-be-sports!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, in a weak and uncertain voice, Arden and
Terry, after a moment of embarrassed consultation,
sang one verse from their prep-school song; something
about &ldquo;Bring Me Violets for My Hair,&rdquo; while
Sim tapped about more like a sparrow than a swan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>At last it was over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not bad,&rdquo; commented Toots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen worse,&rdquo; said Pip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not much,&rdquo; was Jessica&rsquo;s opinion.</p>
<p>Then the sophomores delivered a rhyming ultimatum.
They stood with their heads together and
chanted:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;<i>From yonder orchard, old and green,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Where, &rsquo;tis said, strange things are seen,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>You three, upon this fatal day,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Must gather apples while ye may.</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>At once repair to that dread spot,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>And in your quest dare pass it not.</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Then bring, for our symbolic use,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Fair apples with but smallest bruise.</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Ten perfect fruits, no less, must we</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Your mentors have, in time for tea.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>There was a dramatic pause, following this delivery,
and then, as though they had rehearsed it, as, indeed,
they had, the three sophomores picked up the books
they had deposited on the ground in front of them
while singing, and marched away, leaving the trio
from 513 the center of an excited and thrilled group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it all mean?&rdquo; asked Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it part of the hazing?&rdquo; asked Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must we really go after the apples?&rdquo; asked Arden
in astonishment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mary Todd. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just part of college
life. And you may as well go to the orchard now, while
it is still light and bright. I certainly hope I don&rsquo;t have
to do that stunt. No orchard in mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of us probably will have to gather the apples
later,&rdquo; declared Jane Randall. &ldquo;But a soph, who got a
little friendly with me, said that the best apples were
at the far side of the orchard. So you girls had better
go there at the start, as Toots and her crowd won&rsquo;t
accept nubbins, and you don&rsquo;t want to have to make
two trips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say not,&rdquo; murmured Sim. &ldquo;One is bad
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arden and Terry were still a bit bewildered, even
after this well-meant advice, and Sim declared she was
&ldquo;dying from embarrassment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we may as well go. What do you say,
girls?&rdquo; asked Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, let&rsquo;s! Anything to get away from here!&rdquo; Sim
was regarding the circle of amused girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take our books to our room, will you?&rdquo; Terry
asked Mary Todd. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let you know later how we
make out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fated trio started down the southern slope of
Bordmust Hall hill toward the picturesque orchard
where, even now, though it was not very late, the
shadows were lengthening and the sun had lost some
of its brightness. They crossed a field, deep with grass,
crawled through the bars of a snake-rail fence, and
found themselves beneath the trees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I vote we pick up the first apples we can see,&rdquo;
voiced Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly!&rdquo; agreed Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apples are apples,&rdquo; quoth Sim. &ldquo;Why should we
go to the far end to gather fine fruit when windfalls
may answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, indeed,&rdquo; assented Arden. &ldquo;But still I suppose
we had better not pick up these.&rdquo; With her foot she
kicked out from amid the fallen leaves some withered,
wrinkled, and partly rotted specimens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; declared Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s separate a bit. We can cover more
ground that way,&rdquo; suggested Arden. &ldquo;Whoever first
finds some decent apples must give a shout, and we&rsquo;ll
gather there.&rdquo; She was quite businesslike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Colonel!&rdquo; laughed Terry. &ldquo;&lsquo;You take
the highland and I&rsquo;ll take the low,&rsquo;&rdquo; she sang softly.
&ldquo;Scatter, my lassies!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They separated and began the search in the growing
dusk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>Apples there were, but such poor things, windfalls
and rots, that even the enthusiastic Arden began to
feel discouraged. They might, after all, need to go to
the far end of the orchard. Still, it was delightful
beneath the old, gnarled trees. Their trunks were
shaped like dragons, their branches like Chinese letters,
and the roots, where they cropped out above the
ground, like intertwined serpents grim and black,
seeming to writhe in the shifting shadows. A little
wind rustled the leaves, swung the hanging fruit, and
made the limbs squeak as they rubbed one on the
other.</p>
<p>Here and there they wandered, growing more and
more apprehensive and nervous as the darkness deepened.
There seemed to be something sinister about
that orchard, although it was so close to the life and
joy of Cedar Ridge College. The taxi-man had surely
warned them&mdash;but of what? This was no time to think
about that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Sim suddenly exclaimed. &ldquo;A perfect apple,
red and round!&rdquo; She picked it up from beneath a large
gnarled tree. &ldquo;And there are others,&rdquo; she called.
&ldquo;This way! Over here, girls!&rdquo; Her voice was joyous.</p>
<p>Arden and Terry ran toward Sim. But as Sim
stooped to pick up another apple she saw something in
a pile of leaves. It looked like&mdash;surely not the leg of
blue overalls! A last lingering gleam of the setting
sun, shining through a cleft in the hills, glinted upon
that leg. Sim glided closer. Could it be&mdash;&mdash;?</p>
<p>It was part of an overall suit, and there, thrust out
of the lower end and twisted grotesquely to one side,
was a foot!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-h-h-h-ee!&rdquo; screamed Sim, dropping her apples.
&ldquo;Oh, girls, look here! Quick! Hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>She stood in a panic of terror, rooted as firmly to
the spot, for the moment, as one of the black gnarled
trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Sim? What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; gasped
Terry, the first to arrive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Sim pointed, breathless. She and the
others, for Arden was now one of the trio beneath the
tree, saw more than just the overall leg and the foot.
They saw the huddled form of a man partly buried in
the fallen leaves. And they could see&mdash;his face!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Tom&mdash;the porter!&rdquo; cried Arden. Instantly
she was down on her knees beside him. &ldquo;His
head is cut. We must get help. Sim! Terry! Come here
to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arden was dependable in a real emergency. She attempted
to lift the death-like head. Terry struggled to
help her while Sim bravely tried to straighten out a
crooked arm beneath the senseless form.</p>
<p>It was so terribly tragic. The girls saw where all
that blood was coming from. Tom Scott&rsquo;s forehead
was cut, and the wound appeared to be serious. Realizing
this, the three hesitated about what to do next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; gasped Terry. &ldquo;Is he&mdash;dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Arden answered. &ldquo;I can feel him breathing.
But he&rsquo;s had a hard blow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; faltered Terry, becoming
more and more alarmed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If we only had some water,&rdquo; murmured Sim, &ldquo;we
could&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound of approaching footsteps caused the girls
to glance up. A man was hastening toward them
through the aisles of the black trees of the orchard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; sighed Arden as she let the inert head
fall back on the cushion of leaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is he saying?&rdquo; asked Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing yet,&rdquo; replied Arden, still watching closely
the face of the unconscious man as well as she could
in the fast gathering gloom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is coming?&rdquo; asked Sim, for the approaching
footsteps were pounding nearer.</p>
<p>No one answered.</p>
<p>Then they heard the voice of Tom Scott as he
stirred on awakening from the stupor of unconsciousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My head!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;It&mdash;hurts. But it was
so black and it came at me so quickly&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls were so relieved to hear him speak that
they all waited breathlessly. The running footsteps
came nearer. It was a man. He fairly leaped through
the dark tunnel of trees toward the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get away from here!&rdquo; he snarled. &ldquo;Get away&mdash;you
girls! You&rsquo;re not supposed to come in this orchard.
Get away! I&rsquo;ll take care of him!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>By his voice, for it was now too dark to distinguish
his features, Arden and her chums knew him to
be Anson Yaeger, the grim head farmer and gardener
of Cedar Ridge. They had seen him from a distance
that afternoon, had heard his snarling voice, and
had been told who he was. Now he was living up to
his reputation in ordering them off.</p>
<p>Arden and the others moved away from the still
recumbent form of Tom Scott. But more life was
coming back to him now. He murmured again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t know. I couldn&rsquo;t see&mdash;except that it
was something black&mdash;as black as the hedge&mdash;and it&mdash;got
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the voice of Anson Yaeger broke in:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right! All right! I&rsquo;ll look after you, Tom. You
girls run away. It&rsquo;s all right, I tell you! Go away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His angry command seemed to shatter the calm
darkness of the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><br />CHAPTER VII
<br />Terror in the Dark</h2>
<p>Scarcely realizing how they had changed their
fright into action, Arden, Terry, and Sim found themselves
running away as quickly as they could through
the fast-gathering darkness enshrouding the mysterious
orchard. The cool wind whipped back their hair,
and their feet stumbled on the uneven ground. Loose
stones tripped them, and smashed apples made slippery
spots that once caused Sim almost to fall. But
she quickly recovered herself, ran on, and passed her
chums.</p>
<p>As the three neared the dormitory building, the
grounds about it were deserted, as this was the before-supper
lull.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope no one saw that mad rush!&rdquo; panted Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we going to do?&rdquo; asked Terry as they
slowed to a walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say nothing&mdash;for a while, at least,&rdquo; advised Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo; agreed Sim.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>To this course of action, or, rather, lack of action,
each agreed with unspoken loyalty. They must keep
the secret of the orchard to themselves. It was their
secret. None of the other girls, for the time, must
know anything about the mystery tangled in those
gnarled trees and in the smoky ivy vines that hung
from some branches like tangled snakes. Even the tall
and almost impenetrable hedge that, in one corner,
formed a terrifying tunnel before it opened into the
wide aisles of trees took on a sinister shape and seemed
to add to the mystery as the girls thought of it while
standing in the gleam of lights from the dormitory
building.</p>
<p>They were safe now. They need run no longer. They
could stop and let their panting breaths ease. They
must go inside. Oh, to be able to sit down and calmly
consider what had happened.</p>
<p>But the five flights of stairs between them and their
room! How could they be climbed? The same thought
was in the minds of each one. To get safely inside their
room and throw themselves down upon the beds until
hearts beat a little less poundingly.</p>
<p>It was finally accomplished, somehow. Silently they
reclined in their favorite relaxed positions. No sound,
except a clock-like puffing, disturbed the stillness. The
room was almost dark, only a little gleam filtering in
from the hall through a transom. No one made a
move to turn on a light. Just to rest, for the moment,
was enough.</p>
<p>Gradually they grew calmer. Arden sat up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What an adventure!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;But do you
know what we did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; murmured Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We left the precious apples.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For all I care they can stay there!&rdquo; Sim had lost
all interest. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forget how that poor young
fellow looked! I only wish that old man hadn&rsquo;t chased
us away. Perhaps we could have found out what Tom
meant by that black thing he talked about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d never have the courage to try!&rdquo; murmured
Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, girls,&rdquo; burst out Arden, &ldquo;I think
we&rsquo;ve stumbled on something important! You remember
what Henry, our dear old chaplain, was muttering
about the day we passed him. Something about coming
out of the orchard and some sort of a promise. And
the old taxi-man, too, warned us, in a way. Certainly
that orchard holds a real mystery in its dark leafiness.&rdquo;
Arden smiled a little smugly. A sort of cat and canary
smile, as Sim remarked when she got up off the bed
to switch on a light.</p>
<p>She and Terry both were very thoughtful after what
Arden had said. Perhaps Arden was right. There was
certainly something more than merely queer about the
orchard, it was getting weird and uncanny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think those sophs could have known?&rdquo;
asked Terry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was Sim&rsquo;s opinion. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d never have
sent us there if they had known what was going to
happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be so sure of that,&rdquo; spoke Arden.
&ldquo;Those sophs&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; from Sim.</p>
<p>Footsteps in the corridor outside.</p>
<p>A knock on the door.</p>
<p>A little scream from Terry, a quickly hushed scream,
however.</p>
<p>The door was opened suddenly. It was Toots Everett
and her two familiars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the apples, freshies?&rdquo; Toots demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t got them,&rdquo; Terry stated simply. &ldquo;We&mdash;ah&mdash;we&mdash;dropped
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you did! And you look at us and calmly tell
us you haven&rsquo;t the apples we sent you to get! Well,
you&rsquo;d better get them tonight. It would be just too
bad if the dean had to campus you in your first week
here.&rdquo; Toots paused ominously and resumed. &ldquo;For
going over to the post office without permission.&rdquo; It
was a theatrical finish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get those apples for us tonight!&rdquo; commanded
Jessica. &ldquo;Slip out the back door about eight o&rsquo;clock
and you&rsquo;ll manage it all right. None of the teachers
will notice you then. Of course, you&rsquo;ll have sense
enough to take flashlights.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t any yet,&rdquo; said Sim lamely. &ldquo;We
haven&rsquo;t been to town, you know.&rdquo; She and her two
chums were wondering how the sophomore knew
about the post office visit. Had the chaplain told
them?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No flashlights!&rdquo; mocked Pip. &ldquo;The poor dears!
Then they&rsquo;ll have to go in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; Terry cried out with a dramatic restraining
gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little freshie &rsquo;fraid-cats!&rdquo; sneered Toots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Jessica, &ldquo;purely out of the goodness
of my heart, and not because I like you, I&rsquo;ll let
you take my large flashlight. But don&rsquo;t forget! We
expect those apples before &lsquo;lights-out&rsquo; tonight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With mocking smiles, the sophs withdrew to their
room below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; wailed Sim. &ldquo;More trouble! I don&rsquo;t
want to go back to that orchard when it&rsquo;s so dark!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do and I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Arden. &ldquo;I want to find out
something, but I&rsquo;m a little scared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we all keep together and have a light, it
shouldn&rsquo;t take us long. I think I can find the tree we
were near when&mdash;when&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Terry didn&rsquo;t quite know
how to finish.</p>
<p>Clang-clang! Clang! Clang-clang! It was the bell
calling the students to supper: always a light meal.
The &ldquo;big feed,&rdquo; as the girls called it, came in the
middle of the day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>Wearily the three arose from the beds whereon
they had again cast themselves after the visits of the
sophomores, straightened themselves with pulls and
twists, and joined their classmates in the dining hall.
Their coming hazing task was uppermost in their
minds, consequently they did not feel like talking much.</p>
<p>Terry was elected to get the light from Jessica while
her chums waited in no little trepidation in the main
corridor below, near a rear door out of which they
had been told they might slip without being observed
by those in authority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you get it?&rdquo; whispered Sim, as Terry came
lightly down the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! Did you think I wouldn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was hoping you might not, and then we&rsquo;d have a
good excuse for not going,&rdquo; Sim answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s get started,&rdquo; suggested Arden.</p>
<p>They went out. The night was clear and beginning
to get chilly. Sim knotted her bright scarf more tightly
about her throat. Terry turned up the collar of her
jacket, and Arden snuggled more closely into her long
sweater.</p>
<p>At first, after walking away from the rim of light
that filtered from the dormitory building, they could
see nothing. But gradually their eyes became accustomed
to the darkness and, without switching on the
flashlight, they headed for Bordmust Hall.</p>
<p>For a few of their hesitant steps no one spoke. Then
Terry turned on the flashlight, focusing its beams upon
the ground while they walked slowly along in triangular
formation, Sim and Arden forming the base as
Terry with the light was the apex.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>Nothing disturbed them. All was quiet and still and
so absolutely silent that Terry remarked it was the
&ldquo;perfect state of nothingness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dark orchard seemed miles away. But as they
paused for Arden to tie her shoe, a faint rustling
could be heard. Tired old apple trees were once more
settling down for the long winter sleep after a summer
of fruit producing.</p>
<p>All at once they were there! Right in the orchard.
The stones on the ground seemed to hold back their
unwilling feet. They stopped and listened. Terry
switched on the light but its penetrating beam seemed
only to make the surrounding darkness blacker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, girls! We&rsquo;re just at the first row of
trees. The one we are looking for is farther along.
I remember a funny-shaped one, like a rearing crocodile,
next to it. But wait, Terry! I heard something
moving!&rdquo; Arden froze into motionless silence to
listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let your imagination run away with you,&rdquo;
Terry gently mocked. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just wasting time by
listening, and I&rsquo;ve got a lot of French to do. Let&rsquo;s get
going!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>Sim and Terry walked on. Terry, having seen that
the way, for some little distance ahead, was clear,
turned off the flashlight. They did not want to attract
any possible attention. Arden was following a little
more slowly. They were beneath some gnarled trees
now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flash a gleam, Terry,&rdquo; begged Sim. In the glow
they looked at the leaf-strewn ground. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not
a single apple here! I don&rsquo;t see how we found any this
afternoon!&rdquo; said Sim gloomily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up, old gal! I think this is the tree. That
looks like a pretty good specimen.&rdquo; Terry was examining
an apple in the light of Terry&rsquo;s torch. &ldquo;Pick
them up quickly. If they turn out not to be good, we&rsquo;ll
blame it on the darkness. Hold the bag, Arden. It was
very smart of you to bring it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly the two dropped apples into the paper bag
held open by Arden. They were making what they
thought was a good collection when Arden suddenly
stopped them as she murmured:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen! Did you hear that? Sounded like someone
sneezing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They stood motionless and quiet in the frightening
darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard&mdash;something,&rdquo; Sim whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, whatever it was, it couldn&rsquo;t have been very
close,&rdquo; declared Terry, taking charge of the situation.
&ldquo;If we hurry we can be out of here in another minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With renewed energy they fell to their task once
more. Arden discovered Sim&rsquo;s pile of apples from the
afternoon gathering and was putting them into the
bag; they could not return to those sophs without
filling their orders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>Suddenly the night&rsquo;s silence was broken by a loud
noise: a sound between a sneeze and a snort, as the
girls afterward described it.</p>
<p>Then something like a black shadow tore past the
frightened trio, moving with great speed and thudding
feet, if that tearing scramble could have been made
by feet. In her excitement Terry switched off the light.
The darkness was at once made more dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Help! Help! It&rsquo;s&mdash;got me!&rdquo; screamed Arden,
in a voice filled with terror.</p>
<p>Some strange force seemed to fling her aside, her
skirt being caught and twisted around her legs, twirling
her like a human top. She tried to retain her balance
but toppled over and fell heavily in a pile of
leaves and apples, too frightened to know where she
was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arden!&rdquo; cried Sim. &ldquo;What happened? Where are
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo; demanded Terry trying in vain to
get her fingers on the elusive light switch. &ldquo;Oh, Arden!
Whatever&mdash;was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it just missed me!&rdquo; panted Arden, struggling
to her feet. &ldquo;But whatever it was, it certainly tried to
get me! Oh, for mercy&rsquo;s sake, take those apples and
let&rsquo;s get out of here!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Show a light, Terry!&rdquo; begged Sim. &ldquo;Where are
the apples?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I dropped the bag when that terrible thing
rushed past me and was nearly entangled in my skirt,&rdquo;
Arden confessed. &ldquo;Oh, this is awful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those sophs!&rdquo; muttered Sim, &ldquo;and these unlucky
apples!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beasts!&rdquo; snapped Terry, who at last had the torch
glowing again.</p>
<p>Then, never daring to look behind them, the three
frightened freshmen, with Sim carrying the bag of
apples, Terry focusing the torch on the uncertain
way, and Arden almost in hysterical tears, ran out of
the perilous orchard. This surely had been a terrifying
encounter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But remember again,&rdquo; breathed Sim when she felt
strong enough to do so, &ldquo;the apples are for&mdash;the
sophs, but the&mdash;mystery&mdash;is ours!&rdquo; Good little Sim!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><br />CHAPTER VIII
<br />A Tea Dance</h2>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sim flung the bag of apples with desperate aim
straight at Jessica Darglan, who stood in surprised
dismay near the doorway of her room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re back! We got the apples for you. But don&rsquo;t
ever ask us to go to that orchard again. It&rsquo;s a <i>terrible</i>
place!&rdquo; Arden almost shook her finger at Jessica.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you sophs are going a little too far in this
hazing business.&rdquo; Terry spoke firmly. &ldquo;We tried to
be good sports about it, but we might have been hurt
or killed&mdash;or something! Well, anyhow, here&rsquo;s your
lamp, and you have the apples. Come on, girls!&rdquo; she
finished a little lamely, but a little defiantly as well.</p>
<p>The three frightened freshmen wearily climbed the
last flight of stairs to their room. Never had the sight
of those three beds in a row seemed so pleasant, so
reassuring.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>Terry decided to let her French go until morning.
Arden and Sim thanked their lucky stars they could go
to bed with easy consciences. They had nothing to
prepare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Arden, what was it?&rdquo; asked Sim as she began
to undress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t given us any idea,&rdquo; added Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the simple reason that I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was the answer
made after a moment of thought. &ldquo;It was all so sudden&mdash;and
terrible&mdash;a rushing black shape&mdash;something
getting tangled in my skirt&mdash;twirling me down and&mdash;and&mdash;around&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoosing, snorting, and sneezing like some giant
of an old man with a bad cold,&rdquo; finished Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Arden assented, glad to have been helped
out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The orchard,&rdquo; murmured Terry. &ldquo;Could it have
been&mdash;a snake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re thinking of the Garden of Eden and Eve&rsquo;s
apple, I guess,&rdquo; laughed Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk about it!&rdquo; begged Arden.
&ldquo;Maybe it was&mdash;the wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know it wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Sim calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may have been&mdash;for all I <i>know</i>,&rdquo; Arden said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to bed and try to forget it. College life
should make girls brave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others followed her example but sleep was long
in coming. Adventures like the peril in the orchard
called for pulling covers over one&rsquo;s head, Arden remarked,
and she did exactly that. Darling sleep came
at last.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>In the morning, at breakfast, the trio guardedly
whispered to a few of their friends something of what
had happened, but the real secret they kept to themselves.
There were murmurs of wonder amid promises,
exacted and given, of silence. But the talk spread.
The idea of three freshmen&mdash;etc.&mdash;etc.&mdash;!</p>
<p>It was two days later, though, before an effect was
produced. Then the whole college was called to General
Assembly, and the three in room 513 realized to
what an extent gossip had traveled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any stories which you may have heard about queer
things happening in the old orchard must be taken,
well&mdash;conservatively, at least.&rdquo; It was the dean speaking
to the college students, who for once were all
vitally interested in her discourse. &ldquo;There is not much
danger of our upper class students taking these things
seriously. But in a college of this size, stories travel
with remarkable speed. It would not be to the credit
of Cedar Ridge to have such rumors spread on the
outside. So we shall say no more about it, except to
remark that, apparently, our sophomores this year are
doing a very good job of hazing. It is to be hoped
they will remember where hazing ends and bullying
begins.&rdquo; The dean&rsquo;s usually austere manner suddenly
melted into a kindly interest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She must have heard something,&rdquo; Arden whispered
to Sim. &ldquo;Do you notice she doesn&rsquo;t say exactly what
happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my guess,&rdquo; whispered Sim, &ldquo;she doesn&rsquo;t <i>know</i>
exactly what.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three girls were sitting together in the large
assembly hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Foxy old thing!&rdquo; Terry spoke out of the corner
of her mouth at Arden. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to hear just how
much she actually knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dean had finished with the matter of the orchard.
She swept her glance over the faces raised
expectantly to hers as she broached a new and not unwelcome
subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sophomore Tea Dance will be held this year
earlier than usual; in New York, at the Hotel Chancellor.
The committee, of which Jessica Darglan,
Margaret Everett, and Priscilla MacGovern are the
active heads, ask your support in their undertaking.&rdquo;
A murmur of approval greeted this announcement.
&ldquo;They have voted to give any funds they may raise
to the college treasury for the reconditioning of the
swimming pool. I wish them every success.&rdquo; This was
a real pronouncement.</p>
<p>Then, gathering herself together and teetering on
her toes as if, Terry said, she was getting ready to
jump, the dean dismissed her students.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you just know they&rsquo;d do something like
that!&rdquo; Arden was speaking, as the three chums sauntered
toward their classes in Bordmust Hall. &ldquo;Stealing
our plan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we didn&rsquo;t announce it, Arden,&rdquo; Terry remarked.
&ldquo;That is, if you mean we are to try for the
thousand dollars reward for information about that
missing Harry Pangborn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we haven&rsquo;t done anything,&rdquo; suggested Sim.
&ldquo;Really, you know, Arden&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t they give us a chance? I just know we
can solve that mystery if we have time. I&rsquo;m sure of
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you decided yet,&rdquo; asked Terry, &ldquo;where you
think you saw the original of that reward-poster
picture?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; Arden had ruefully to admit. &ldquo;But I
shall. And now those sophs&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, more power to them if they can raise the
money for the swimming pool, I say,&rdquo; spoke Sim
philosophically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never shall I forget, scared as I was, the expression
on the face of Jessica as we flung the apples at
her! It was almost worth the fright we had,&rdquo; Terry
ventured, to change the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what we can do, though, to get a little
even with them,&rdquo; suggested Arden. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t tell,
no matter how much they ask, just what happened.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Arden, we&rsquo;ll do that. Now, don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s
talk any more about it. I&rsquo;m tired of the word orchard.
I&rsquo;d much rather talk about the tea dance,&rdquo; Sim returned,
arranging her books more comfortably. &ldquo;Do
you think we can go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course! Why not?&rdquo; asked Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;boys, you know. We couldn&rsquo;t get any of
our own friends from home to come this far for us,&rdquo;
Sim decided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been thinking about this dance, have you,
Sim? Now, I never would have thought that!&rdquo;
laughed Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I have! I like dances. I&rsquo;ve been thinking
about this one to such an extent that when I saw the
notice on the bulletin board I asked Mary Todd what
about it, and she and Ethel Anderson and Jane Randall
have already written to their three brothers&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my! Has each one three brothers who are
eligible for tea dances?&rdquo; gasped Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;one each,&rdquo; went on Sim, laughing. &ldquo;What do
you expect? Anyhow, that&rsquo;s how much I&rsquo;ve been thinking
about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite a lot of thinking,&rdquo; Terry remarked,
&ldquo;for you, my little one! I might say that perhaps you
took a great deal for granted, but if it works out all
right, I&rsquo;ll be just as glad as you are. Did you have the
sisters send their brothers our pictures? That one of
you in the school play, Sim, dressed as an old man, is
good.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly! Of course I didn&rsquo;t. Anyhow, as long
as we pay for the bids, those boys ought to be glad to
go. They don&rsquo;t have to dance with us all afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, stop, you two! Do let it go, as long as Sim
has engineered it this far. It will be fun, very likely.
Russ Albono&rsquo;s orchestra is grand, and we all have
new dresses. There are more important things to consider,&rdquo;
Arden decided. &ldquo;We must get our hair and
nails done and see about a room in the hotel. I&rsquo;ve
never been there, have you? Think of going to a real
college tea dance in a big New York hotel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was there once on my birthday,&rdquo; Sim remarked.
&ldquo;My loving parents took me to dinner and the theater.
We stayed at the hotel a whole week-end. I loved it!&rdquo;
She sighed, remembering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll find it as wonderful this time,&rdquo; remarked
Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us hope so,&rdquo; murmured Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Malvern is to be the official chaperon. You
must report to her before the dance and after it is
over, as you leave,&rdquo; announced Sim. &ldquo;I should think
she might be pretty tired of answering the phone calls
of the girls to her room when they notify her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, Sim, how did you find out so much?&rdquo; asked
Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked here and there,&rdquo; Sim admitted. &ldquo;I also
found out that we are to go to New York the afternoon
of the dance, which is on Saturday. We don&rsquo;t
have to be back here at college until nine that night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a bit of liberty&mdash;for Cedar Ridge,&rdquo; commented
Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear! Here we are at Bordmust, and we&rsquo;ll
have to separate just when the talk is getting exciting!&rdquo;
exclaimed Arden. &ldquo;But as soon as you two can,
come back to 513, and we&rsquo;ll complete our arrangements,
will you?&rdquo; she begged as they reached the grim
building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; nodded Sim and Terry.</p>
<p>Groups of students on the steps were discussing the
dean&rsquo;s talk, the coming tea dance, and the ever intruding
lessons, which, dance or not, must be endured.</p>
<p>Suddenly Sim saw Mary Todd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you heard anything, Mary?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s too soon. Give them a few more days,&rdquo;
called back Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so anxious, Sim,&rdquo; advised Arden. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d
think we just couldn&rsquo;t wait to find out about those
boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I <i>am</i> anxious. If they don&rsquo;t take us, I don&rsquo;t
know how we&rsquo;ll get there.&rdquo; Sim sighed, certainly a
little downcast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. We&rsquo;ll go all right, and probably
make a big hit, too!&rdquo; Terry was climbing the steps
now. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think it out in Latin class. I do some of my
best thinking there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;See you later!&rdquo; Arden waved a hand, laughing.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m due at math, worse luck!&rdquo; and she hurried into
the building.</p>
<p>Terry and Sim followed. They were already lost
in daydreams of music, laughter, lights, and gayety:
the prospective coming dance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, listen, Sim,&rdquo; exclaimed Terry suddenly, taking
hold of Sim&rsquo;s arm to assure attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, darling?&rdquo; joked Sim. &ldquo;Got a better
idea for our dance boy supply?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, nothing about that. But you know our Tom
who got that mysterious blow the other night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I heard him telling one of the gardeners
about it, and he was laughing it off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s wrong about that?&rdquo; demanded Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounded flooey to me. He said he merely tripped
over a tree stump and another stump cut his head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he did,&rdquo; Sim casually answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And maybe he <i>didn&rsquo;t</i>,&rdquo; retorted Terry significantly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><br />CHAPTER IX
<br />The Disappearance of Sim</h2>
<p>Class matters went all too slowly between the
time of the tea dance announcement and the affair
itself. Lessons were slighted with bold abandon as
the girls made their preparations, their universal excuse
being:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can make it up later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last it was the day. Soon after noon the college
buildings began emptying rapidly, and excited students,
carrying overnight bags, hurried to the little
station for the New York trains.</p>
<p>It was great fun going in to the city. The seniors
and juniors were, of course, literally &ldquo;on their own,&rdquo;
but the lower-class girls were chaperoned by the ever-watchful
Mrs. Malvern.</p>
<p>The train was crowded, but Arden and her friends,
after some tactful pushing, managed to get seats together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was fine of Mary Todd to help us get the boys
to go to the dance with. And it wasn&rsquo;t so hard in her
own case, for she lives so near New York. None of
the boys we know could travel so far for a tea dance.&rdquo;
Terry was chattering excitedly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was nice,&rdquo; Sim agreed. &ldquo;I was certainly relieved
when I heard they could come. If Mother lets
me have a house party at Christmas, we could invite
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean the boys or the girls?&rdquo; asked Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean the boys,&rdquo; supplied Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How perfectly grand!&rdquo; exclaimed Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, we haven&rsquo;t seen the boys yet,&rdquo; continued
Arden. &ldquo;So perhaps we had better wait until
we do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And of course, I haven&rsquo;t asked Mother about the
party yet, either. It was just an idea,&rdquo; Sim concluded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;Sim!&rdquo; was all Arden and Terry could say to
that admission, and presently they lapsed into silence
while the train clicked on.</p>
<p>The ride to New York from Cedar Ridge was
hardly long enough, and it seemed no time at all before
the various groups of girls were alighting from
the variously colored taxis in front of the Chancellor
Hotel.</p>
<p>Then up to their rooms in the gorgeous bird-cage
elevators, to unpack their dresses and give last-minute
touches to hair, hands, and complexions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sim looks simply darling!&rdquo; observed Arden in an
aside to Terry. &ldquo;As long as she is small and child-like,
I think she&rsquo;s wise in making the most of it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she does look sweet,&rdquo; agreed Terry. &ldquo;And
you look nice, too, Arden. I like that color on you.
Your hair has a dandy wave. I think that was a good
beauty shop, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; assented Arden. &ldquo;And to complete
the circle, Terry, you look&mdash;wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sim was so busy preening herself before a large
glass set in the closet door that she took no part in the
conversation until, all at once, she seemed satisfied
with her appearance and, turning to her chums, remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your dress is just perfect, Arden&mdash;blue is surely
<i>your</i> color. And green is yours, Terry: you look sweet.
And I think we all three are credits to Cedar Ridge.
But let&rsquo;s go down. It&rsquo;s late, and we have to find Mary
and meet the boys. They must have been waiting a
long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they left their room after many last-minute
touches, and with some temerity descended to the ballroom.
Already lights were casting soft glows over the
tapestry-hung walls. The orchestra was playing a
lively tune, and several couples were dancing in the
stately Louis XIV room. Smartly dressed girls and
good-looking boys were laughing and talking together
in little knots, their eager anticipation being distinctly
felt if not actually heard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen Mary Todd anywhere?&rdquo; Sim had a
chance to ask Helen Burns, a classmate, who was apparently
waiting for someone at the door of the ballroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hello, Sim!&rdquo; Helen greeted. &ldquo;You look lovely!
Yes, I saw Mary and Jane and Ethel and a whole lot
of boys over there in that small room.&rdquo; She pointed
toward a sort of alcove off the dancing space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, gosh, Arden!&rdquo; Sim&rsquo;s poise was leaving her.
&ldquo;What shall we do now? Wait! There&rsquo;s Mary. I see
her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, let&rsquo;s go over and speak to her, of course,&rdquo;
suggested Arden. &ldquo;Your nerve seems to be deserting
you, Sim. You got us into this very nicely, but you
don&rsquo;t seem so brave about it just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lead the way, Arden, and we&rsquo;ll follow,&rdquo; Terry
said, smoothing her bright hair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been in a
situation just like this before. I feel almost as frightened
as though I were in the orchard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey there! No orchards tonight, girlie,&rdquo; cautioned
Arden. &ldquo;Come on, children! We&rsquo;ll get the introductions
over with, and the rest will be easy.&rdquo; Arden
started toward Mary who was chatting with several
young men.</p>
<p>Then Mary looked up, saw Arden coming toward
her, followed by Sim and Terry, and went halfway to
meet the trio. So it wasn&rsquo;t so difficult, after all, to
cross to the small room where the boys were waiting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Arden,&rdquo; said Mary formally, &ldquo;may I present my
brother Jim? This is Arden Blake, Jim. I&rsquo;ve told
you about her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; greeted Jim. &ldquo;Mary wrote me
all about your adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arden was wondering just what Mary had referred
to, but there was no time to ask, for the others were
now being presented, Sim and Terry taking their turns.
Sim was now her vivacious self, and Terry had lost all
her nervousness. Could one boy have brought them
such reassurance?</p>
<p>Then Ethel Anderson&rsquo;s brother Ed, a tall, good-looking
boy, asked Sim to dance, and soon she was
humming &ldquo;Tea for Two&rdquo; as though they were old
friends. Yes, boys did inspire confidence just like that.</p>
<p>Terry was dancing with Dick Randall, talking and
laughing as they whirled about the big, beautiful room.
It truly was exciting.</p>
<p>Next Arden and Mary Todd&rsquo;s brother Jim joined
the dancers. Arden unconsciously made a pretty picture
as she looked up smiling at the handsome boy.
She was thinking how easily the introductions had
gone off after all and how glad she was to be there.
Then, as the music stopped, she glanced about her inquiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are not as many here as I thought there
would be,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;I wonder if the sophomores
will clear expenses and make something for repairing
the swimming pool?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You sound almost as if you wished they wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
observed Jim, somewhat curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that, exactly,&rdquo; went on Arden. &ldquo;But, you
see, I had sort of planned on raising the money for
the pool myself&mdash;with the help of Sim and Terry. I
suppose it doesn&rsquo;t matter, though, if they have <i>more</i>
than they need, just as long as they don&rsquo;t have <i>less</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk like Alice in Wonderland and you remind
me of her, too,&rdquo; laughed Jim. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s
rather a tall order, isn&rsquo;t it? Trying to raise such a
large sum by yourselves&mdash;just you girls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About a thousand dollars,&rdquo; admitted Arden. &ldquo;I
know it sounds awfully conceited, but back at school,
in the post office&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arden was interrupted by Ed Anderson coming to
claim her for a dance. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you some other time,&rdquo;
she explained gayly to Jim, and to her waiting
partner she smiled a little coquettishly as she put up
her arms in the correct position as he danced away
with her. No thought of ugly orchards now; even college
could be forgotten with that rapturous music.
Arden was a pretty dancer.</p>
<p>The rest of the afternoon dissolved into a lovely
kaleidoscope of color, music, and lights. The three
sophomore hazers of the trio from 513, headed by
Toots Everett, managed the affair extremely well as
far as the social end of it was concerned. Arden and
her chums had occasional glimpses of &ldquo;the apple
trio,&rdquo; as they were sometimes thought of, surreptitiously
regarding them and the good-looking boys with
whom the freshmen danced so often.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>Was there envy in the glances?</p>
<p>Now and then an ominous &ldquo;good-bye&rdquo; intruded
upon the pleasant dream Arden was living in, until, as
though she were slowly awakening, she realized that
the party was over.</p>
<p>The boys and girls of Arden&rsquo;s little group were
gathered in a corner near the ballroom door. Like
overlapping broadcasts of sound, the farewells and
thank-yous crossed and crisscrossed among them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to say good-bye to Sim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ed Anderson&rsquo;s smiling request caused them all suddenly
to stop talking and look at one another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; Dick Randall asked. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
seen her for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. She should be somewhere around
here. We must find her quickly. We have scarcely time
to dress and catch the eight-thirty train back to Cedar
Ridge!&rdquo; Arden exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She knew we were to meet her here when the
dance was over,&rdquo; Terry said petulantly. &ldquo;Come,
Arden, let&rsquo;s go look for her! We have to hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><br />CHAPTER X
<br />What to Do</h2>
<p>Like the reflection of a cloud in a pool of water,
a shadow passed over the face of Arden Blake as
Terry spoke to her. But she acted quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry we must go so soon,&rdquo; Arden said to the
somewhat puzzled boys. &ldquo;But if we miss that train
we&rsquo;ll probably be campused. I&rsquo;m sure Sim has some
good excuse for her absence, but we&rsquo;d better find her
and learn what it is. I&rsquo;ll have to say good-bye for her.
I really don&rsquo;t know what to think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Dick Randall remarked. &ldquo;You and
Terry go along. Perhaps Sim is upstairs waiting for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t usually do things like this. But I suppose
we really should go up,&rdquo; Arden agreed. &ldquo;We
haven&rsquo;t much time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saying good-bye again, Terry and Arden left the
group of boys and walked toward the elevator. But
when they reached the room, high up in the large
hotel, Sim&rsquo;s bag was closed and packed, as Terry discovered,
on the middle of the bed. And she exclaimed:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t here, Arden! We must phone Mary
Todd&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; Arden promptly offered. &ldquo;She may be
down there talking things over.&rdquo; She hurried to the
instrument.</p>
<p>But Mary Todd hadn&rsquo;t seen Sim since early afternoon!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say anything to anyone, will you, Mary?&rdquo;
Arden pleaded. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want Mrs. Malvern to know
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; Mary answered. &ldquo;But Sim will
turn up. Don&rsquo;t worry! &rsquo;Bye!&rdquo; and she hung up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t there, either,&rdquo; said Arden, turning to
Terry. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the next move?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terry considered. &ldquo;Well, this is a pretty big place.
Sim may be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The telephone jingled shrilly. Both girls sprang to
answer, but Terry got there first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mrs. Malvern,&rdquo; she said sweetly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all
ready, and we&rsquo;ll be in the lobby in a few minutes. Yes.
Good-bye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly she turned from the telephone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what shall we do? Mrs. Malvern will see that
Sim isn&rsquo;t with us! Think of something, Arden!
Quick!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to go down, anyhow,&rdquo; said Arden, pulling
her dress over her head. &ldquo;Maybe, in the crowd,
she won&rsquo;t notice that Sim is missing. Hurry, Terry,
and change your dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am hurrying. I&rsquo;m as nearly ready as you are. We
mustn&rsquo;t show we are excited. She really could be&mdash;lots
of places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever possessed Sim to do a thing like this?&rdquo;
Arden was struggling with her garments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s probably got some idea into her head. Unless
she&rsquo;s been kidnaped and is being held for a ransom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both girls stopped their dressing, suddenly frightened,
Terry no less, though she had spoken the words.
They had been spoken jokingly, but the possibility of
such a terrible happening was not pleasant to consider.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Terry! Do you think we better tell Mrs. Malvern
after all? The police&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! I was only joking. I have a lot of confidence
in Sim. She can take care of herself. She knows
people in New York. If she isn&rsquo;t in the lobby when we
get there, we&rsquo;ll have to decide what to do then.&rdquo; Terry
was putting on her hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready. I&rsquo;ll take her bag and mine. You shut
the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arden swept a last glance around the room. She
stepped into the corridor, followed by Terry, who
pulled the door shut. They both quickly looked down
the long hall. It was empty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry, Arden, into the elevator, before someone
sees there are only two of us when there should be
three!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the greatest of good luck the elevator came
quickly in answer to their ring. It was almost filled
with chattering girls, and when it reached the ground
floor it was impossible to see who got off.</p>
<p>The girls for Cedar Ridge were assembled in the
magnificent lobby; a happy, chattering, laughing
group. Terry and Arden, in unspoken agreement,
worked themselves gradually as near to the center of
the throng as they could, hoping Mrs. Malvern&rsquo;s gimlet
eyes would not note the absence of Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, girls, get together!&rdquo; The chaperon was
herding them toward the door leading to the waiting
cabs. &ldquo;Tell the driver to take you to Thirty-third
Street tube station and there take a train for Hoboken.
When you get there, ask at the information desk
which is the next train for Cedar Ridge, and don&rsquo;t
forget to sign in as soon as you get back. That is important.
We shall have to separate from now on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So far so good. Terry and Arden guiltily got into
a gaudy taxi with three other girls. The two were
thinking so much about Sim; wondering if, should
they go on thinking, some subconscious influence
would not cause someone to ask about her. The only
thing to do was to talk to the other girls about the
dance to keep their thoughts occupied with that subject.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did they make any money, do you know?&rdquo; Arden
asked a strange girl, one of the three riding with her
and Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They cleared expenses, but I heard they only have
a few dollars over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a nice party, anyhow,&rdquo; Terry put in, looking
anxiously out of the window. &ldquo;The music was
grand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that ended the half-hearted attempt at conversation.
Both Arden and Terry had too much on
their minds to do much talking. The other girls were
intimately whispering among themselves. They seemed
to give no thought to the missing Sim, nor to the fact
that Arden and Terry had been two of a trio, inseparable,
but were now only a duet.</p>
<p>Their problem was a difficult one.</p>
<p>Where was Sim?</p>
<p>If she was not waiting at the tube station or in
Hoboken, what should they do? How could they get
back to Cedar Ridge without Mrs. Malvern or someone
with inquisitive authority finding out about the
missing girl?</p>
<p>Arden privately decided, if they did not find Sim at
either station, to tell Mrs. Malvern at the first opportunity.</p>
<p>Terry, whose thoughts were following the same
line as were Arden&rsquo;s, decided, if they reached Cedar
Ridge and found no trace of Sim, that it would be best
at once to telephone from college to the parents of
the missing girl and ask for advice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>There was a milling throng on the platform of the
Thirty-third Street tube station on one side of which
trains left for Jersey City and Newark, and on the
other side for Hoboken and thence to Cedar Ridge.
As well as they could, Terry and Arden peered
through the crowd for Sim. But she was not to be
seen, and the hope thermometer in their hearts went
nearer the zero mark.</p>
<p>The train was crowded, and it was almost impossible
for Arden and Terry to converse above the noise.
It didn&rsquo;t matter. They had nothing of interest to talk
about, now. They looked anxiously at each other.
Were they deserting Sim? Or rather, were they not
showing real confidence in her? She must be safe! The
excitement of the travel was helping to cheer her
chums.</p>
<p>When Hoboken terminus was reached and the
crowds poured out as they had flowed in, once more
the two sought anxiously among the many faces. But
though there were scores of their fellow students
hurrying to catch the next Cedar Ridge train, Sim was
not among them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She may be on the platform waiting for us,&rdquo; suggested
Terry with a hope she did not feel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Arden murmured prayerfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>They almost stumbled up the concrete steps in their
haste. The ramp, from the iron gates of which departed
many trains for many places, was another place
of milling crowds outside the station. A man in a portable
information booth was answering questions in a
very patient manner.</p>
<p>By listening, without asking, Terry and Arden
learned from which track their train departed and
the time. They had a few precious minutes left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s look around out here and then go inside,&rdquo;
proposed Terry, who was lugging along Sim&rsquo;s bag
with her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t here,&rdquo; Arden sighed, after a search.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go inside the station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There they looked about the big vaulted room:
ticket offices on one side, a rank of telephone booths
on another, a buffet restaurant, a magazine stand, a
large candy booth. All of these spots were eagerly
scanned without result.</p>
<p>Apparently just to say &ldquo;hello&rdquo; to friends, Terry
and Arden went from one group of waiting girls to
another, glimpsing the pretty, animated faces, but
Sim&rsquo;s was not among them. It seemed hopeless.</p>
<p>Now, really frightened, Arden and Terry clung together
as the stentorian voice announced their train in
long-drawn accents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to go!&rdquo; murmured Terry desperately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. We can&rsquo;t wait any longer. But she may be
in the train.&rdquo; It was a sort of last hope for Arden.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We can look, if it isn&rsquo;t too crowded,&rdquo; Terry suggested.</p>
<p>But it was. In all the coaches, for most of the college
girls had caught this train back, were repeated
the same scenes, the same talk and laughter that had
marked the going trip. The seekers could not locate
Sim in the coach where they were crowded, and they
did not dare pass from one car to another as the train
quickly gathered speed after leaving Hoboken.</p>
<p>The ride back was almost a nightmare for Terry
and Arden, and when the train pulled into the Morrisville
station, which was the college stop, they were
pale and more worried than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe she is already here,&rdquo; breathed Terry, as
they alighted. It was a brave attempt to brighten the
situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe. Let&rsquo;s hurry and see if she has signed in.&rdquo;
Arden was only too glad to seize on Terry&rsquo;s suggestion.</p>
<p>They almost ran along the path from the station to
the college. Terry still insisted on clinging to Sim&rsquo;s
bag, though Arden wanted to do her share of carrying
it. Then up those back-breaking stairs and into the
big recreation room where the registry book was kept
for this occasion.</p>
<p>Signing their own names, the two frightened freshmen
scanned the pages for Sim&rsquo;s.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, Arden, she hasn&rsquo;t come in.&rdquo; Terry turned
sadly from the book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left a space between your name and mine,&rdquo;
Arden said, &ldquo;so in case Sim comes in later she can slip
hers in without being caught. Hurry, Terry, let&rsquo;s get
to our room so we can talk this out and decide upon&mdash;something.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><br />CHAPTER XI
<br />Sim</h2>
<p>Miles away from Cedar Ridge, Sim Westover
idly turned the pages of a movie magazine. She was
quite pleased with herself as she sat in a commuters&rsquo;
train, speeding toward Larchmont. It was dark now,
and as Sim looked from the window her face was reflected
in the glass as in a dull mirror. Just a hint of a
shiny nose, but it was enough to cause her to open her
envelope bag and search for her compact.</p>
<p>But what were those white envelopes?</p>
<p>Surely she hadn&rsquo;t forgotten to leave that carefully
composed note for the dean&mdash;and the one to Arden
and Terry!</p>
<p>Yes, she had forgotten!</p>
<p>&ldquo;My word! They&rsquo;ll be worried to death!&rdquo; Sim
whispered in a gasp of dismay. &ldquo;What a stupid thing
to do! Write notes explaining everything and then
take them with me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>Sim settled herself deeper into the soft green plush
of the seat and looked helplessly at the envelopes bearing
the imposing red and gold seal of the Chancellor
Hotel. She could imagine Terry and Arden dashing
madly about asking everywhere for her. And she had
intended to leave the note right where they would see
it&mdash;on the bed near her packed bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; mused Sim, &ldquo;if only they don&rsquo;t do anything
rash, such as notifying the police or phoning to my
folks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The adventure she had planned to be such a fine
thing was fast losing its savor.</p>
<p>Suppose her father was not in Larchmont, after all?
But he must be. In his last letter to Sim he had mentioned,
casually, this trip which was a reason why he
couldn&rsquo;t be in New York to greet her at the tea dance.
He would be in Larchmont.</p>
<p>It had seemed such a fine idea, when Sim learned
the sophomores had not made the amount of money
necessary even to start the repairs on the swimming
pool, just to go to her father and ask him for it. It
would be such a fine thing for the college, and Sim
really must do some swimming. She felt that she was
entitled to it after coming to Cedar Ridge, having
seen the pictures of the pool in the prospectus.</p>
<p>The others were dancing as Sim&rsquo;s grand idea was
engendered within her, and it seemed too bad to interrupt
them. Besides, Arden would, very probably, try
to stop her. The simplest thing would be just to write
the notes, explaining, and go ahead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>The desk clerk at the hotel told her, when she
asked, that she had fifteen minutes to get a train for
Larchmont from the Grand Central Station. Sim was
so glad she had remembered her father had written
he was to be there for the week-end at the Newman
home&mdash;planning another large branch store for business
expansion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear! What a fix to be in! I suppose I&rsquo;ll be
expelled! Mother will feel terribly bad, and Dad&mdash;&mdash;Oh,
dear!&rdquo; Sim sighed aloud.</p>
<p>But there was nothing she could do now. There
were the forgotten letters which would have made
everything all right. She had hurried up to the room,
slipping away from the dance, had written the notes,
put them in her bag, and changed her dress. She intended
leaving them just before going out of the room.
But a glance at the electric clock showed her there
was little time to catch a taxi for the Grand Central
in time to make the train, and in her haste&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>The train ran along smoothly. The clickety-click of
the wheels over the rail joints mocked Sim with their
ever recurring:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgot! Forgot! Forgot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She grew more upset and worried. She pulled back
her coat sleeve and glanced at her wrist watch.</p>
<p>Nine o&rsquo;clock!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>By this time the girls would be taking the train for
Morrisville. What had they done about her disappearance?
Sim hated to think about it. This was, indeed,
the deepest hole she had ever been in.</p>
<p>The conductor opened the door and shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Larch-<i>mont</i>! <i>Larch</i>-mont! All out for LARCH-MONT!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sim gathered her things together and prepared to
leave.</p>
<p>As she alighted from the train, the thought came to
her that she must at once go in the station and telephone
Arden. But another glance at her watch caused
her to hesitate. Arden and Sim might not be in Cedar
Ridge yet. So she decided to wait until she reached the
house of her father&rsquo;s friend and to telephone from
there.</p>
<p>She approached a taxi and gave the address to the
driver. The ride was not long, and soon was on the
steps waiting to be admitted at the Newman house.</p>
<p>It was Mr. Newman himself who opened the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Sim Westover!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;What are
you doing here? We thought you were safely in bed at
Cedar Ridge. But come in! Take off your things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-evening, Mr. Newman,&rdquo; Sim said quickly.
&ldquo;I should be at Cedar Ridge, but something very important
came up, and I decided, in a hurry, to come up
here to see Dad. I was in New York at a dance. Dad
is here, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, Sim, he isn&rsquo;t. He telephoned me, late this
afternoon, that he couldn&rsquo;t make it after all. Is anything
the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sim&rsquo;s face was a study in many expressions as she
faintly replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I guess there is&mdash;now. Everything would
have been all right if I hadn&rsquo;t been so forgetful!&rdquo; Sim
was close to tears, and the sight of her mother&rsquo;s dear
college friend (both ladies had graduated at Cedar
Ridge) caused Sim almost to break down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, Sim!&rdquo; greeted Mrs. Newman, sensing, as
she hastened into the hall, that something was wrong.
&ldquo;Have you had anything to eat? I thought not. Come
into the dining room. Marie can get you some tea and
sandwiches, at least. Then you can tell us all about it
while you eat, and you&rsquo;ll feel better. It isn&rsquo;t serious, is
it?&rdquo; This last prompted by a look at Sim&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it isn&rsquo;t going to be very pleasant, I&rsquo;m
afraid.&rdquo; On the way to and in the dining room, while
a hasty lunch was made ready, Sim blurted out the
whole story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you see,&rdquo; she finished, &ldquo;I must get word to
Arden or Terry as quickly as possible, and it must be
managed so that I&rsquo;m not found out as missing or I
shall probably be expelled. I&rsquo;m away without leave.
I must get back tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go back tonight? Impossible, my dear! Can&rsquo;t you
stay with us until morning?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think not. If I can slip back all may yet be well.
But if I have to explain to the dean&mdash;&mdash;No, it
couldn&rsquo;t be done. There must be a train back tonight,
isn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned questioning eyes on Mr. Newman.</p>
<p>He looked at some time-tables, of which he had
several in his smoking room, and announced:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d never get back until late&mdash;very late&mdash;by
train. But if you feel you must be back in college before
morning&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do. Oh, yes, I do, Mr. Newman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the only thing is for me to drive you there.
We can make good time at night. I know the roads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Newman! I couldn&rsquo;t dream of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut, tut, Sim! It&rsquo;s the only way. I don&rsquo;t mind. It
will be a little diversion for me. I&rsquo;ll have the chauffeur
get the car out now. He can do the driving. I&rsquo;ll sit and
talk to you, and the way won&rsquo;t seem so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Newman, you&rsquo;re wonderful! Now I must
phone Arden at once to be watching for me. Luckily
our room is on the front of the dorm. How long do
you think it will take?&rdquo; Sim, getting up from the table,
at the session of which she had much improved in
spirits, was planning rapidly now. Perhaps all would
yet be well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About three hours, I should say,&rdquo; Mr. Newman
answered. &ldquo;It will be slow going from here until we
get into New Jersey, and then we can make time. You
ought to be back <i>at</i> college around midnight, though
whether you can get <i>in</i>&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I must phone Arden or Terry. Oh,
what a lot of trouble I&rsquo;m causing!&rdquo; Sim&rsquo;s eyes filled
with tears, but she blinked them back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, now, my dear, never mind!&rdquo; soothed Mrs.
Newman. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll help you all we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the kind of people they are,&rdquo; Sim told
Arden, later. &ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t forgotten what it is to be
young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took some little time to get a telephone connection
through to Cedar Ridge, and Sim lived years in
moments, she thought, while waiting for Arden to
come to the phone. Finally the voice came to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Arden? Yes, I&rsquo;m all right. I&rsquo;m up at Larchmont
with friends of Dad&rsquo;s. Did they find out about
me? No? Good! Listen! Here&rsquo;s my plan. I&rsquo;ll tell you
all how it happened later. Someone might hear us if
I talked too long now. I&rsquo;m driving back&mdash;yes, driving.
I&rsquo;ll get there about midnight. Don&rsquo;t fall asleep. When
we get to the entrance&mdash;the outside gate, I mean&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
toot the horn three times. You and Terry slip
down and let me in. Do you understand? Fine! I&rsquo;m
leaving right away. Good-bye, darling! I&rsquo;ll explain
everything later. I&rsquo;m quite all right, and nothing has
happened. Good-bye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hung up and turned to her friends, murmuring:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s over, thank goodness!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s get going, Sim!&rdquo; Mr. Newman was
now almost as much excited as was Sim herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try to sleep on the way out, Sim dear,&rdquo; advised
Mrs. Newman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m having robes and a soft cushion
put in the car. You can snuggle up in a corner of the
sedan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought she was going to talk to me!&rdquo; chuckled
Mr. Newman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I will&mdash;if I can find anything to talk
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you mustn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; decided his wife. &ldquo;Sim must try
to get some sleep. You will, won&rsquo;t you, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will. Luckily tomorrow will be Sunday, and
I can sleep late in my room&mdash;if I get there. Thank
you both&mdash;so much! I&rsquo;ll never forget this&mdash;never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sim put her arms about Mrs. Newman&rsquo;s neck and
kissed her affectionately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my poor dear! I know just how you feel. You
meant it all for the best, and there is really no harm
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; said Sim a trifle grimly as she followed
Mr. Newman out to the big sedan that was waiting,
with the chauffeur at the door, on the drive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><br />CHAPTER XII
<br />Midnight Mishap</h2>
<p>Arden&rsquo;s slippered feet pad-padded up the dark
stairs like small, softened trip-hammers as she hurried
away from the telephone to inform Terry of the good
news that Sim was safe and on her way.</p>
<p>She pushed open the door of 513 and shut it quickly
behind her, panting and excited from her swift upward
flight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terry! Terry!&rdquo; she began breathlessly. &ldquo;It was
Sim&mdash;on the phone. I talked to her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;good! Is she&mdash;all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. She didn&rsquo;t have time to talk much. She was
&rsquo;way up in Larchmont. Said she&rsquo;d explain everything
later. She is coming back around midnight, and she
wants us to watch for her and let her in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was she doing in Larchmont?&rdquo; the practical
Terry wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t guess,&rdquo; replied Arden. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to wait
until we see her. She said she was all right and nothing
had happened. I can hardly wait until she gets
here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Midnight,&rdquo; murmured Terry. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to
stand our turns at watch as they do aboard ships. Now
that I know Sim is safe, I&rsquo;m suddenly very sleepy.
How is she coming&mdash;train?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. She&rsquo;s driving. We&rsquo;ll have to listen for a car.
She thought she&rsquo;d better walk in from the entrance
instead of having the car drive right up, so no one
would hear. They&rsquo;ll toot the horn so we&rsquo;ll know.&rdquo;
Arden went to the window and gazed at the black
scene below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s absolutely dark out,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;I hope
we&rsquo;ll be able to see the lights of the car as it comes up
the road. We&rsquo;d better get undressed in case anyone
comes in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Terry agreed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the first watch.
Let&rsquo;s make them an hour each. You sleep until I call
you. I&rsquo;ll sit here on the window seat. If I go to sleep
I&rsquo;ll probably fall off, and that will wake me up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly they got into their pajamas. Terry put on a
robe and slippers and curled herself on the window
seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never remember a blacker or stiller night,&rdquo; she
remarked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad Sim isn&rsquo;t alone. She&rsquo;s with friends
of her father&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose we can let her in all right? What
if we can&rsquo;t get the door open?&rdquo; Arden asked nervously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think that possibility out while I&rsquo;m on watch.
You go to sleep as quickly as you can. Don&rsquo;t worry so
much, Arden. You&rsquo;ll be gray by morning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be exhausted by morning, anyhow. However,
toodle-oo&mdash;sailor, beware, and all that sort of thing!
I&rsquo;m going to try to get some rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was not a sound in the room for at least five
minutes when Terry suddenly flung a tennis ball with
a thudding crash at a marauding mouse. The ball, one
of a supply of such ammunition kept in readiness for
just this contingency, bounced a few times and rolled
under a bed as the mouse, with a protesting squeak,
darted back into a hole beneath the baseboard.</p>
<p>The college had settled for the night. The appearance
of the mouse was one proof of this.</p>
<p>Terry tried not to be too comfortable and kept
shifting her position on the window seat. It was getting
cold, so she pulled a blanket off her bed and
wrapped it around her. The next thing she remembered
someone was shaking her to wakefulness. It
was Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine sailor you are! You were sound asleep! Sim
might be trying to get in. You get in bed, Terry. I&rsquo;ll
watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; sleepily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;all right, Captain. Let&rsquo;s see how you make
out. Anyhow, she can&rsquo;t be here yet&mdash;it&rsquo;s too early.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>Terry rolled herself into the bed, and Arden took
her place on the uncomfortable window seat. After a
few minutes there she leaned forward and pressed the
side of her face to the cold, dark glass in order to
look as far as possible to the east, the direction from
which the traveling car would come. But the highway
beyond the college grounds showed no blinking lights,
so Arden drew her knees up to her chin under her robe
and stared moodily out into the night.</p>
<p>What was going to come of all this, she wondered?</p>
<p>What might happen if Sim were caught was too disheartening
to think of, so Arden tried to piece together
the events of the afternoon in a brave effort to
keep awake.</p>
<p>The whole affair had so many missing links, though.
It was just Sim&rsquo;s usual good luck that she was not
missed by Mrs. Malvern when the girls returned to
school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; sighed Arden at the thought of how
she and Terry would have been put to it to explain.
But they had not been obliged to do any explaining&mdash;so
far.</p>
<p>The mouse, grown bolder in the silent darkness, was
conducting a rustling, rattling search among some
papers on a desk for tasty crumbs. Arden got up
quietly and reached for another tennis ball. As she
stood up she looked once more toward the highway
and waited in strained tenseness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>Yes, she was sure of it. Far down the road a light
bounced about as a speeding car neared the college.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terry! Terry!&rdquo; Arden whispered. &ldquo;I think they&rsquo;re
coming! Wake up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terry was up in an instant and glided over to the
window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a car, sure enough. But we&rsquo;d better make certain
before we start down. Keep watch while I fasten
the belt of my robe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; whispered Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it stopping at the far gate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s going on. Oh, no, it isn&rsquo;t, either. It
hasn&rsquo;t passed the gate. It must be Sim! We&rsquo;ll give her
a few seconds to get out and walk up the drive. I hope
she knows enough to stay on the grass and not on that
crunchy gravel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust Sim for that,&rdquo; murmured Terry. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m
ready. But give Sim time to get to the door. We don&rsquo;t
want to wait down in the dark lower hall any longer
than we have to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Come on! And don&rsquo;t use your flashlight unless
you have to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cautiously Arden opened the door and, followed
by Terry, stepped out into the dark corridor which
seemed to stretch for miles and miles the length of
the building, disappearing into blackness at the end.
At the top of the first flight of stairs leading down
from the floor of the 513 room was a small light bulb
doing its little best to dispel the gloom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>Holding hands, Arden and Terry tiptoed down
the first flight. Arden&rsquo;s free hand slid noiselessly along
the polished banister rail. Now and then the stairs
creaked and snapped with what seemed to be the noise
of a gun.</p>
<p>They stopped to rest at the first landing, not so
much from physical weariness as from the nervous
strain. On the first and several other landings was a
large window facing the distant orchard. The orchard
was now only a black blur but Arden and Terry
thought they could see the gnarled trees beneath
which they, with Sim, had been so frightened on the
occasion of the hazing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t go down there now for anything!&rdquo;
whispered Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down where? Do you mean to let Sim in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I mean that awful orchard. What do you suppose
is in there, Arden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew. No, I don&rsquo;t. Let&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t talk about
it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The subject isn&rsquo;t very heartening in the present
circumstances,&rdquo; agreed Terry in queer little gulps.</p>
<p>They tiptoed down to the next floor. Every now
and then they halted, trembling, waiting for some door
to open and lead to their discovery. But the other
students must, indeed have been sleeping the sleep of
the just, for Arden and Terry eventually reached the
lower entrance hall without mishap.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>The ground glass of the heavy front doors showed
a little lighter than the surrounding wooden frames.
Arden was there, fumbling with the old-fashioned key.
Terry was watching apprehensively.</p>
<p>Suddenly two dark figures were outlined on the glass
of the door. One was that of Sim!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have it open in a moment, Sim!&rdquo; Arden panted,
working desperately with the key. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s turning
now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And none too soon!&rdquo; whispered Terry. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m
so frightened!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lock clicked. Arden turned the knob and pulled
the heavy door inward, just far enough to admit
Sim, who slithered in with the speed of a wind-blown
leaf. Thrusting her gloved hand out through the opening
crack she had slid through, while Arden braced
herself to prevent the portal from swinging too far
back, Sim waved to someone unseen and hoarsely
whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night, Mr. Newman! I&rsquo;m all right now.
Thank you a thousand times! I&rsquo;ll write to Mrs. Newman.
Good-bye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With all Arden&rsquo;s care she could not hold the heavy
door firmly enough to prevent a deep though not loud
banging sound as it closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arden!&rdquo; gasped Terry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help it. Quick! Help me turn this key
back. It&rsquo;s so stiff!&rdquo; Terry gave her aid. Then the two
turned to the midnight entrant in the dark precincts
of Cedar Ridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sim!&rdquo; whispered Arden, flinging her arms about
her chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Arden!&rdquo; returned the wanderer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, you two!&rdquo; Terry interrupted. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
not safe yet. Take off your shoes, Sim, you bad girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sim bent down to comply with this cautionary advice,
but suddenly stood crouched, frozen with dismay.
That noise could be from only one cause.</p>
<p>Someone was coming down the stairs!</p>
<p>Even as the three frightened freshmen realized this,
a white face was outlined by a gleaming electric torch
on the landing above them. A voice, high-pitched in
anger, floated down to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the dean looking like Lady Macbeth, holding
an electric candle above and in front of her, so that
the gleam made curious shadows on her stern face.
And above all other possible colors she was wearing a
cerise robe! Perhaps deans were secretly like that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to your room at once and report to me in the
morning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Authority turned with all her dignity and
swept away, while the girls, with consternation knocking
at their hearts, crept up the stairs to the harbor of
their room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><br />CHAPTER XIII
<br />Aftermath</h2>
<p>While Sim, in the room the three girls shared, undressed
with weary slowness, Terry and Arden sat
like youthful inquisitors and shot question after question
at her until the whole foolish episode was at last
laid bare before them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sim, you must have had a touch of the sun, or
something, to do what you did,&rdquo; Arden said spiritedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over now, Arden&mdash;there&rsquo;s no use crying
over the straw that broke the camel&rsquo;s back or the
spilled milk that got in the eye of the needle in the
haystack, or something,&rdquo; Terry remarked soothingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; murmured Sim. And then, with sudden
energy: &ldquo;But, oh, girls! I forgot to tell you the most
exciting part! We came in as far as we could on the
back road&mdash;you know, where it circles the college
grounds near the orchard and finally comes out at the
main highway?&rdquo; She looked questioningly at her
hearers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we know,&rdquo; said Arden, and Terry nodded,
adding:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I thought,&rdquo; went on Sim, &ldquo;that we had
better stop for a minute to see if there were any lights
in this dorm before we went any farther. So we did,
but I didn&rsquo;t notice just where we were, as I was looking
so hard toward where I knew you two would be,
and on the watch for me, I hoped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we were,&rdquo; said Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Thanks a lot. But listen to this.&rdquo; By Sim&rsquo;s
manner Terry and Arden knew something startling
was to be told&mdash;something so startling that, for the
moment, it drove from their minds the thought of
having been caught by the stern dean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suddenly,&rdquo; said Sim, &ldquo;away down at the far end
of the orchard, I saw a light bobbing about!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye gods, Sim! Did Mr. Newman see it? What
was it?&rdquo; demanded Arden excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He saw it, and so did the chauffeur, for he said
something about why someone should be out in a
gloomy old orchard at that time of night with a lantern.
I was frozen with horror!&rdquo; Sim was enjoying
herself and watching the eyes of the girls widen with
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, go on!&rdquo; whispered Terry. &ldquo;What did you
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t say a word&mdash;just sat there in the car
and watched the light coming closer. I felt sure it was
someone looking for me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;For you?&rdquo; gasped Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I mean trying to find out who was coming
back to college so late, against the rules&mdash;afraid
they&rsquo;d find me out, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; Terry murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty soon,&rdquo; resumed Sim, &ldquo;we said that it was
someone carrying a lantern&mdash;holding it down low so
it was only shining on the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop, Sim&mdash;tell us who it was!&rdquo; Terry
begged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who it was. He didn&rsquo;t pass very
close, and from the way he was carrying the lantern
I could only see his legs and part of one hand, but&mdash;&rdquo;
Sim paused dramatically&mdash;&ldquo;he seemed like a young
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he see you?&rdquo; Arden blurted out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps; though if he did, he didn&rsquo;t seem to care.
He went stumbling on his way toward Bordmust.
Then I came out of my daze and told Mr. Newman
we&rsquo;d better be getting on our way. Of course, he
thought it queer that a man should be out that hour
of night near a girls&rsquo; school, but I passed it off by saying
it was the watchman on his rounds. But, girls, it
wasn&rsquo;t, though even the little I could see made me
feel he belonged around here. But, here&rsquo;s a question,
a hard one, really: What do you suppose he was doing
in the orchard after midnight?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine. It&rsquo;s all very queer. And,&rdquo; went on
Arden, &ldquo;I hope it just stays merely queer. But now, to
be practical&mdash;much as I know you hate to be that way,
Sim&mdash;I think we had all better get some sleep. We&rsquo;ll
have to see Tiddy in the morning, and we had better
have our wits about us when we do.&rdquo; Arden yawned.
The conference was ended. The girls got into bed.
The light was extinguished. Silence settled over the
room.</p>
<p>Terry, as usual, lost no time in getting to sleep.
Sim, utterly exhausted, was sighing heavily as she burrowed
under the blankets.</p>
<p>But Arden was never more wakeful. All the various
adventures the girls had shared in the past were as
clear in her mind as though she were watching a
motion-picture film of them. She tossed and turned.
Through the gloom Arden fancied she could see
again the face of the man described in the reward
placard in the post office.</p>
<p>Arden was still certain that, somewhere, she had
seen that face before. The fright she and her chums
had in the orchard, was, in some way, linked with
the lantern man Sim had seen that night. Then, intruding
upon that situation, it was borne to Arden
that the swimming pool was in as hopeless a shape as
on their arrival at Cedar Ridge.</p>
<p>What would Sim do now?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>And what would happen at the morning interview
with Miss Tidbury Anklon, the severe dean? Arden
was desperate. She would never get to sleep at this
rate. As quietly as she could, she arose, went to her
bureau, and managed, by feeling, to find the bottle of
aspirin tablets. She swallowed one, taking a few sips
of unpleasantly tepid water from the glass at her bed-side
table, and tried to compose herself again. She
noticed that Sim and Terry were breathing like tired,
sleeping children.</p>
<p>Arden lay flat on her back, as she had read somewhere
this was a good thing to do when one could not
get to sleep. Closing her eyes tightly, she began to
count:</p>
<p>&ldquo;One! Two! Three!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly the white woolly sheep leaping gayly over
a black fence became huge red apples rolling toward
her as she was stretched helpless on the ground. She
put up her arms to ward them off, but to no avail. Soon
she was covered completely by an immense pile of the
fruit. Her voice, as she sought to cry for help to
Terry and Sim, would not sound. She tried in vain to
crawl out from beneath the heap of red apples as hard
as stones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arden! Arden! You&rsquo;re dreaming! Wake up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sim was shaking her gently. Slowly Arden returned
to consciousness. She raised herself on one elbow and
stared dazedly about the dim room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sim&mdash;I&rsquo;ve had such a horrid dream!&rdquo; Arden took
a deep breath and sat up. &ldquo;Oh, dear, it&rsquo;s almost morning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had, in truth, slept nearly the night through. A
gray dawn, shot with glints of the rising sun, pressed
against the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a few hours we&rsquo;ll be in Tiddy&rsquo;s office,&rdquo; Arden
sighed. &ldquo;I wish it was all over!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sim had nothing to say to this. She reached over
and tugged at the blankets covering the still slumbering
Terry, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might as well wake up, too. It&rsquo;s morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terry grunted sleepily. &ldquo;What? Oh&mdash;it&rsquo;s you, Sim.
I remember. Today&rsquo;s the day. What time is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven-thirty,&rdquo; supplied Arden, looking at her
watch. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get dressed and have it over with. We
can see Tiddy in an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yawning and stretching, the girls dressed and
started down for breakfast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><br />CHAPTER XIV
<br />The Dean Decides</h2>
<p>Breakfast was, if anything, duller and more
gloomy than usual. So many &ldquo;shining morning faces&rdquo;
only made the three freshmen involved in the escapade
of the night before more nervous. When the meal was
over and Arden, Sim, and Terry were waiting in the
dean&rsquo;s outer office, they were almost sick with dread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, young ladies!&rdquo; Tiddy opened the door to
the inner sanctum herself and, with an almost imperious
gesture of her lean brown hand, waved the
three in ahead of her.</p>
<p>The office was large and bright. Green carpet
covered the floor to the uttermost corners. The windows
were draped with neutral-toned curtains. The
founder of the college, in the form of a highly-varnished
oil painting of a stern-faced, dark-featured
and white-haired man, looked down at the three from
a vantage point over the dean&rsquo;s desk.</p>
<p>Miss Anklon asked and noted down the names of
her visitors, though they were quite sure she well knew
them already. She began:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This prank of yours, my dear girls, is something
we do not countenance at this college. You were put
upon your honor when you went into New York and
were expected to return as your classmates did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked sternly over the tops of her glasses.
Then she resumed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I remember correctly, you two were in your
night clothes and this young lady was still dressed. Is
that right?&rdquo; She directed her gaze specifically at Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Anklon,&rdquo; Sim answered in a weak
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you will explain yourself, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought it would cause so much trouble,&rdquo;
Sim began. &ldquo;When I learned that the sophomores
didn&rsquo;t make as much money at the dance as they hoped
to, I just decided to go to my father and ask him
for it.&rdquo; She paused uncertainly. &ldquo;I came to this college,
instead of going to some other, because I hope
to become&mdash;&rdquo; she paused and then went on&mdash;&ldquo;because
the swimming pool looked so lovely in the catalog.&rdquo;
Sim glanced shyly at the dean, whose face betrayed
none of her feelings. It was no time to speak of expert
diving ambitions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is hardly a reason for coming to college,
Miss Westover. But go on with your story. Why were
you returning at such a late hour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father wasn&rsquo;t where I thought he would be,
and I forgot to leave the notes I wrote, explaining my
absence and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>Gradually Sim blurted out the whole story, Arden
and Terry now and then adding a little to the telling.
When Sim finally ended her recital, Miss Anklon was
as stony as before. She sat behind her polished desk
and looked at the girls more sternly than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you have told me the truth, Miss Westover,
although it seems strange you should be so heedless.&rdquo;
Miss Anklon tapped her desk with a pencil.
&ldquo;You other girls were almost as much to blame as
Miss Westover. If anything had happened, you would
have been responsible. While you are here in this college
we are entrusted with your welfare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused a moment, looked up at the dark-faced
founder as if for inspiration, and continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides the seriousness of your act, I must tell
you that you three girls do not seem to be starting
your college life in the right spirit. Although you have
been here for only a short time, you have already attracted
some, shall I say, undesirable attention? Yes,
that is it. Those stories about the orchard were your
doing&mdash;am I not right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time the dean looked directly at Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were not stories, Miss Anklon,&rdquo; Arden
began. &ldquo;We really were chased by something while we
were in the garden gathering apples as a hazing stunt.
And we did find the gardener&rsquo;s helper lying wounded
on the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>The dean bowed her head in frosty acquiescence and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would have been better if you had come to me
and told me of your&mdash;your experiences, instead of
telling them to so many impressionable girls. Do you
know I have received letters from several worried
parents as a result of your spreading of this tale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We tried not to talk of it, Miss Anklon, but it got
around in some way. I think everyone in the college
would like to know what really happened in the
orchard.&rdquo; This time it was Terry who spoke with all
the dignity at her command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to that, Miss Landry, the gardener, Tom, fell
over a tree root, so I am told, and struck his head.
Anything that chased you must have been a product of
your too vivid imagination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no&mdash;no, Miss Anklon!&rdquo; Arden was emphatic
in her denial, but the dean held up a quieting, protesting
hand. Arden looked at Sim as if to say: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like
to tell her how it hurt when I sat down hard upon
those stones!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dean, seeming to gather herself together for a
final statement of the case, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this has nothing to do with your latest
escapade. I regret very much that I must take this
action, but I am forced to tell you that all three of
you will be campused for three weeks and lose all your
privileges.&rdquo; Miss Anklon was stern and unsmiling. &ldquo;I
do not wish you to tell your classmates of your foolish
experience, Miss Westover. It is best kept quiet. You
may all go now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>For several seconds the three freshmen stood facing
the dean but saying nothing. The severity of their
punishment was so great that they were stricken
speechless. No going into town to shop or to the
movies. No week-end guests. And not to leave the college
grounds at all for three weeks!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Anklon,&rdquo; Sim was the first to speak, &ldquo;you
don&rsquo;t know how much my swimming means to me. I
realize, now, how wrong I was to go away without
permission, but Arden and Terry&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do, Miss Westover, I have made my decision!&rdquo;
Tiddy was at her fearful worst. &ldquo;Good-morning!&rdquo;
The girls realized that the interview was
over and that the decision was final.</p>
<p>Responding with almost whispered &ldquo;good-mornings,&rdquo;
the three left the office and walked slowly
toward the tennis courts. With one accord they sat on
a white-painted bench and gazed moodily at a spirited
doubles game.</p>
<p>The ping of the balls seemed to find echoes in the
dull throbbings of their hearts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we were fortunate not to be expelled,&rdquo;
Arden said timidly, after a long silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We might just as well have been. We can&rsquo;t go
anywhere. We can&rsquo;t do anything. Added to that, we
can&rsquo;t even swim!&rdquo; Sim was quite unhappy as she answered
Arden&rsquo;s attempted philosophy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take it so to heart, Sim,&rdquo; Terry advised.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all in the same boat. We can have lots of fun
here, just the same. It will be a good chance for me to
get caught up on my French.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the spirit!&rdquo; exclaimed Arden. &ldquo;We can give
more time to solving the mystery of the orchard. And
I&rsquo;ll have that pool fixed yet: you&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean with the reward money you&rsquo;re going to
get for finding that missing Pangborn chap?&rdquo; asked
Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Arden nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t done a thing toward that yet,&rdquo; spoke
Terry. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t even know whether or not he has
been found, restored to his worried friends, and the
reward paid to someone else. Don&rsquo;t you think we had
better check up on it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we must,&rdquo; Arden agreed. &ldquo;And though we
can&rsquo;t leave the campus even to go to the post office
and see if that reward poster is still there, still, perhaps
we can do something. They can&rsquo;t keep us out of
the orchard, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except that I&rsquo;m not going there again at night,
not for ten swimming pools!&rdquo; declared Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; Sim added. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t suppose,&rdquo; she
went on, &ldquo;that the mystery or the terror, or whatever
you want to call it, of the orchard has anything to do
with the missing man and the thousand dollars reward,
do you, Arden?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a delicious mystery it would be if it worked
out that way, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; exclaimed Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re making fun of my well-meant efforts,&rdquo;
spoke Arden a trifle stiffly, &ldquo;why, I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, not at all!&rdquo; Terry made haste to say, Sim
chiming in with a murmured denial also. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;re
going to help you all we can as soon as this horrid
campusing is over. Really, there must be some reason
for thinking this missing young man might be in this
neighborhood, or it wouldn&rsquo;t have said so on the
poster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arden has the right of it there,&rdquo; Sim declared,
&ldquo;and it&rsquo;s sweet of both of you not to mind this so
much. But I feel very badly about it. I got you into
trouble, and I got Tiddy down on all of us.&rdquo; Sim was
impatiently kicking a clump of grass. &ldquo;Well, we can&rsquo;t
do anything about it now. So let&rsquo;s go back and write
the real story home before our families have a chance
to hear it from Tiddy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><br />CHAPTER XV
<br />The Alarm Bell</h2>
<p>When it came to writing letters home, each girl
approached her family from a different viewpoint,
naturally. Arden, who was the most interesting writer
of the three, was inclined to dramatize. Her missive
was filled with descriptions, reflecting the fears they
had felt at Sim&rsquo;s disappearance and their resentment
at the punishment inflicted by the dean. All this was
set forth vividly.</p>
<p>Terry was diplomatic in her letter. Her mother, she
knew, would worry needlessly if she felt that the girls
were in any danger. So she made prominent mention
of the good times they were having, culminating in a
mistake they had mutually made which resulted in a
curtailment of some of their privileges.</p>
<p>Sim was writing rapidly, her eyes bright and her lips
compressed into a stern, determined line. She finished
first, and after closing the envelope and sealing it, she
scratched on the address and turned to her friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may as well tell you, before you hear it outside,&rdquo;
Sim began and hesitated, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve written to my
father for permission to come home!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sim! Not to stay! Don&rsquo;t leave us now, when things
will be so dull here for Arden and me if you go!&rdquo;
Terry begged.</p>
<p>Sim looked uncompromising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t go, Sim! Don&rsquo;t mail your letter. I
feel as though I am to blame. Anyhow, Sim, there&rsquo;d
be nothing for you to do at home. Three weeks aren&rsquo;t
so long.&rdquo; Arden arose and patted Sim maternally on
the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t just three weeks. It&rsquo;s the whole school
year!&rdquo; Sim declared. &ldquo;It will take a long time to fix
the pool, even if they get the money. Besides, I was
told by my math teacher that I&rsquo;d probably flunk out
at mid-year if I didn&rsquo;t improve, and I&rsquo;d rather go
home before that happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we can help you, Sim,&rdquo; Terry promised.
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you think it over? Even if we are campused,
I know of a few parties the girls have planned, and
they&rsquo;ll be fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arden decided to try a new method of approach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sim, I wouldn&rsquo;t mention it if I didn&rsquo;t want you to
stay,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But you got us into this, even if you
meant it all for the best, and even if you do leave,
Terry and I will still be campused. There are lots of
other things to do besides swimming, and, don&rsquo;t forget,
we have a mystery here that no one dreams about
but us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry about you and Terry, but right now I
don&rsquo;t feel like being a good sport. I&rsquo;ll go to Tiddy and
ask her to let you two off.&rdquo; Sim hesitated. &ldquo;But I want
to go home, Arden. Don&rsquo;t ask me to stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you feel you must go, Sim, all right. But what I
ask you to do is not to mail your letter for a few days.
Write another in its place, at least temporarily, and
say everything is settled. And then, if you still feel the
same way&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Arden shrugged and turned aside.</p>
<p>Sim left her desk and walked slowly to a window.
The peacefulness of the scene below, framed by the
trees in their bright autumn array, must have had
some influence on the perturbed girl. For, after a few
moments of silent contemplation, Sim swung around
and exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Arden. I&rsquo;ll think it over. You can hold
this letter for three days, and I&rsquo;ll write another to
send home. But it&rsquo;s only because of my friendship for
you both that I&rsquo;m doing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great, Sim! You won&rsquo;t be sorry. We&rsquo;ll forget
about it now and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A small shuffling noise stopped Arden in the midst
of her exultation. It came from the direction of the
door, and, even as the three looked, a bright blue and
white envelope was pushed under the portal. Terry
picked up the missive and opened it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; she exclaimed in delighted surprise, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
an invitation for a party tomorrow in the gym. The
sophomores are giving it to the freshmen, and we
must,&rdquo; she was rapidly reading the note, &ldquo;all wear
some sort of a costume. Oh, how precious!&rdquo; She was
gleefully excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What fun!&rdquo; With the suddenness of youth Arden
closed her mind to the subject of Sim threatening to
go home and she began to plan for the party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can we wear?&rdquo; asked Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t much in the way of costumes,&rdquo; Arden
admitted. &ldquo;I suppose, though, we can wear riding
habits or blacken our faces and slick back our hair.
We&rsquo;ll probably have more fun that way than if we
wore draperies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; Terry agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be a little break for us after what we know
is in prospect,&rdquo; said Sim in a low voice.</p>
<p>After lessons, the next day had been gotten through
in some fashion and, following supper, the three
hurried back to their room. Sim put on Terry&rsquo;s riding
clothes, which were much too big, and Terry wore a
part of Sim&rsquo;s sport suit with a woolly cap belonging
to Arden. As for Arden, she put on a short, tight
skirt and a sweater belonging to Jane Randall and
knotted a scarf about her throat, Apache style.</p>
<p>Then, using a soft eyebrow pencil, the girls adorned
their lips with villainous mustaches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do we look?&rdquo; asked Sim, trying to pose in
front of a mirror that showed only part of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terrible!&rdquo; laughed Terry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way we want to look,&rdquo; decided Arden.</p>
<p>Down in the large gymnasium cr&ecirc;pe paper was used
to cover the steam pipes, and many streamers, in the
college colors, disguised the bare whitewashed walls.
The room was crowded with noisy, laughing girls. At
one end a portable phonograph was playing, with the
loudest needle obtainable, a popular dance tune.</p>
<p>Arden and her two particular friends were met at
the door by their sophomore tormentors, Toots
Everett, Jessica Darglan, and Priscilla MacGovern.</p>
<p>Toots came forward and gave Sim a large paper
carton made in imitation of a traveling bag. It was
adorned with huge purple and green paper bows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A gift for our most widely traveled freshman!&rdquo;
said Toots with a laugh. &ldquo;You must keep this with
you until refreshments are served. Those are the
rules.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sim smiled grimly and accepted the box gracefully.
So her story was known all over college in spite of the
dean&rsquo;s prohibition?</p>
<p>Arden and Terry received large, blank exercise
books in which to keep a record of their engagements:
gentle sarcasm when it was evidently known they
couldn&rsquo;t make any for three weeks at least.</p>
<p>One by one the freshmen were given articles to
show up their various faults, failings, and follies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>The party was soon well under way and progressed
happily. The girls who could lead were the most
popular dancers that night. In fact, those girls were
booked well ahead as partners.</p>
<p>Arden was dancing with Jane Randall at the far end
of the gymnasium when she happened to glance up at
one of the windows. What she saw startled her so
that she made a mis-step and caused Jane to exclaim:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arden wanted to say she was looking with all her
eyes, but she did not dare call her partner&rsquo;s attention
to what had so disturbed her. For, as she glanced up
at the window, Arden saw gazing down at her with
strange malevolence a mocking, smiling face. Then, in
a second, it was gone, and only the black square of
glass remained.</p>
<p>Arden was almost shaking with fright, so much so
that she faltered in the dance. She glanced quickly at
Jane to learn whether she had noticed the face, but
now Jane was smiling over Arden&rsquo;s head at the antics
of some capering freshman.</p>
<p>As she circled the room with Jane, Arden&rsquo;s fears
subsided somewhat, and she resolved to say nothing
about it to Jane. Then, when the record had played
itself out, that dance came to an end. For a moment
following the last strains of the music there was a lull
in the noise of talk and laughter.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, breaking in on the happy, peaceful
silence, as though it had been planned, came the slow
and mournful tolling of a heavy bell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>Dong! Ding-dong! Ding-dong!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; questioned several.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we unmask now?&rdquo; others wanted to know.
They thought it a signal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard a bell ring like that since I&rsquo;ve
been here at Cedar Ridge,&rdquo; said a demure little sophomore
in a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t rung&mdash;in a long time,&rdquo; said one girl in a
low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is it?&rdquo; Arden demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why does it ring now?&rdquo; Terry wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; called the impulsive Toots Everett.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something wrong somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That old outside fire-alarm bell hasn&rsquo;t been tolled
since we had the modern telephone system installed,&rdquo;
said one of the teachers who was overtaken in the hall
by a rush of students from the gymnasium. The dance
was momentarily forgotten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a fire!&rdquo; gasped Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hurry out!&rdquo; proposed Sim.</p>
<p>They were all hurrying.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><br />CHAPTER XVI
<br />Arden&rsquo;s Adventure</h2>
<p>The moon looked down upon a strange party of
girls a moment later, for they had all rushed out of
the gymnasium after the ringing of the alarm bell.
Blackened faces and slicked-back hair, some in tattered
garments and others in borrowed finery, sophomores
and freshmen crowded forward to that side of the
building where hung the bell.</p>
<p>But when they reached the spot nothing was to be
seen. The bell rope was still swaying as though recently
tugged at, but the hands that had done it were
not in evidence. The bell itself still faintly vibrated
from the recent violent clanging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, at least here&rsquo;s something they can&rsquo;t blame us
for,&rdquo; said Sim to the curious Arden and Terry. &ldquo;We
have perfect alibis and dozens of witnesses. This time
somebody else can be campused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Sim,&rdquo; Terry agreed. &ldquo;But the point is&mdash;who
did it? It&rsquo;s rather a childish thing to do&mdash;going
about pulling bells and then running away. It doesn&rsquo;t
frighten anyone in the least, if that&rsquo;s what it was intended
for.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was silly, that&rsquo;s true, Terry; but listen to this.&rdquo;
Arden motioned for her two chums to come closer to
her. &ldquo;Come over here where the others won&rsquo;t hear.
We don&rsquo;t want to have Tiddy blaming us for any more
alarming stories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arden! You have something to tell us, I know!&rdquo;
Terry was pulling Sim away from a group of chattering
girls. &ldquo;Come over here, Sim. Arden knows something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three from 513 separated from the main crowd
of disguised girls, and Arden began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was dancing with Jane Randall when something
made me look up at one of the high gym windows,
and there I saw a strange, white face staring in at
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arden&mdash;you didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; gasped Sim quickly. &ldquo;Do you
mean directly at you the face was staring?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seemed so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think that was the person who rang the
bell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, my dear Watson, is just the point. It was
such a short time after I saw the face that the bell
rang, it couldn&rsquo;t have been done by the person who
looked in at me through the window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How thrilling! For Pete&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t let anyone
know what you saw, Arden. If you do we&rsquo;ll be in more
trouble!&rdquo; Terry said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Sim agreed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll keep it under our
hats until we find out something more. The others are
going back in, now. We&rsquo;d better go in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sophomores and freshmen, so rudely disturbed
at their reconciliation party, having investigated as
best they could in the uncertain moonlight, and having
discovered nothing more than that the evidence of the
swaying rope indicated the bell had rung (which evidence
their ears already testified to), were returning
to the gymnasium.</p>
<p>But before they went in, though just how it started
no one appeared to know, they were all doing a sort of
snake dance in the silvery sheen of the moonlight.</p>
<p>Twisting and turning, the line of masquerading girls
in fantastic figures circled beneath the old alarm bell
that hung on a projecting beam out from the side of
the building. It thus projected to allow the sound of
its alarm to vibrate freely in all directions. Above
their heads and out of reach of the hands of the tallest
of the girls, dangled the weathered rope attached to
the bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been a very tall person who could
reach that rope!&rdquo; panted Terry as she circled with
Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A veritable giant,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;None of the
girls could have done it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. That&rsquo;s what I thought.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; demanded Terry,
who had been caught in the human maelstrom by some
strange girl and whirled about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t quite know,&rdquo; said Arden.</p>
<p>Screaming and laughing, the sophomores in the lead
took the freshmen running across the campus and
stopped in front of the dormitory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night, freshies!&rdquo; cried Toots and some of
the leaders. &ldquo;And happy dreams!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means the end of hazing,&rdquo; said Arden. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
always done this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness for that!&rdquo; murmured Terry.</p>
<p>The party was over. Then the girls, sophomores
and freshmen, formed a friendly circle and sang
&ldquo;Autumn Leaves,&rdquo; the alma mater song. The girls&rsquo;
voices carried softly through the moonlit night and
even the most unromantic was impressed with the
beauty of the words and melody.</p>
<p>Then, bidding one another good-night, the happy
students hurried to their respective rooms, talking
excitedly. And the dean and her helpers settled more
comfortably in their beds, knowing that for another
term this affair was successfully over.</p>
<p>The door of 513 shut on Arden, Sim, and Terry.
For a moment they stood looking at one another, and
then, as if by agreement, they began to laugh; hysterical
laughs but none the less hearty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you do look such a sight, Sim!&rdquo; Terry gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why bring that up?&rdquo; Sim chuckled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But we had a lovely time,&rdquo; Arden said. &ldquo;Even if
there was a mysterious bell ringing and a face&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us more about that,&rdquo; begged Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you all I know. I saw a face&mdash;an old
man&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m sure, staring in at me from the window.
Then the bell rang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; demanded Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we could find out, perhaps we could solve the
mystery of several other things that have happened
around Cedar Ridge,&rdquo; Arden said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that bell,&rdquo; went on Sim. &ldquo;I heard some of the
girls talking. It seems it is an old alarm bell, to be rung
in case of fires. But when the telephone system was
put in the rope that originally reached close to the
ground, so help could be summoned from the town and
from nearby residents, was cut off. And it was cut off
so high up that no ordinary person, standing under
the rope, could reach it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why was that done?&rdquo; asked Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it was found,&rdquo; Sim explained, &ldquo;that when
the rope was left long enough to be reached, some
students, thinking it fun, rang the alarm. That was
long before our time. So the dean had the rope cut
short.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t she take it off altogether?&rdquo; asked
Arden.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I asked a soph that,&rdquo; explained Sim, &ldquo;and she told
me it was thought best to leave most of the rope in
place so if ever it was necessary to sound the old bell,
it could be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how, if the rope was high up?&rdquo; Terry inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By standing on a ladder, I suppose. Don&rsquo;t ask me,
for I really don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With determination they began washing off the
marks of the eyebrow-pencil mustaches, using cold
cream, and finally they were ready for bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Arden in tones that told her
chums she had made up her mind seriously, &ldquo;something
is going to happen, I feel sure of it.&rdquo; Pressed
for details, she would say nothing more.</p>
<p>But a few evenings after this, up to which time
nothing of moment had happened save that the three
from 513 began to feel more and more their campused
bonds, a thick hazy fog enveloped the college
grounds, spreading to the near-by town and villages
about. Arden was walking alone from the library back
to the dormitory. The fog seemed suddenly swept in
from the distant sea, settling in the low places so that
the upper stories of the building seemed floating in
the air.</p>
<p>Arden thrust her hands into the deep pockets of her
skirt and in one felt the letter Sim had entrusted to
her&mdash;the letter asking her father for permission to
leave college. The excitement of the masquerade party
and the mysterious bell-ringing had done nothing to
lighten Sim&rsquo;s depression. She was still determined, it
seemed, to carry out her intention.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>Sim didn&rsquo;t seem to care about anything. She was
not the least bit excited by the bell-ringing nor by the
strange face, and evidently had dismissed them from
her mind.</p>
<p>Arden felt there was no time to be lost if Sim was
to be kept at Cedar Ridge. The strange face she had
seen through the obscured window when she was dancing
with Jane Randall had seemed vaguely familiar,
but she had glimpsed it for so short a time that it was
impossible to recognize it. No one else had seen it, of
that Arden was certain, for no one had spoken of it,
and there were no more stories current of mysterious
doings about the college.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sim will just pack up and go home unless something
is done to make her change her mind,&rdquo; thought
Arden as she walked along through the fog. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m
going to do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Campused or not, she would now go to the little
railroad station and send a telegraph message to her
always sympathetic father, asking him for the money
to put the swimming pool in order. That would cause
Sim to remain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>Arden had everything in her favor for concealment,
and she needed concealment in this risky undertaking.
The fog, becoming more dense every minute, and the
fact that she was alone, would allow her to reach the
station unobserved. Also it was just the time when
most of the students were in their rooms preparing
to go down to supper in a short time.</p>
<p>Arden ran through the gathering gloom across the
campus and toward the post office. The yellow gleaming
lights of the railroad station beckoned to her
with their flickering rays from the other side of the
tracks.</p>
<p>There was always the chance that someone from the
college might be in the little suburban station looking
up trains, inquiring about baggage or express shipments,
or sending a telegram. But Arden, risking the
discovery of her voidance of the campus prohibition,
kept on her rather perilous way. At the same time she
was trying to be cautious.</p>
<p>First, she walked with light footsteps toward the
window of the telegraph and ticket office nearest the
tracks. She tried to peer through this window into
the waiting room beyond but could see nothing through
the murky glass and the heavy mesh of wire that covered
it, save the indistinct figure of the ticket agent
whose duties were combined with those of baggage-man,
train dispatcher, telegraph operator, and occasional
expressman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try the side window,&rdquo; Arden determined, and
through this she was able to glance into the deserted
station. There was no one in the waiting room, as far
as she could see: not even one of the few town taxi-drivers
escaping from the heavy fog and the chilly
dampness of the approaching night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s luck!&rdquo; Arden thought. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m quick I can
send the telegram and be out of here before anyone
sees me. Of course, the smart thing to have done
would have been to write out my message before I
came here. But I think it won&rsquo;t take long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dark brown door leading into the waiting room
was heavy and stuck at the sill. That many feet had
kicked it loose was evidenced by several dents and
scratches showing at the bottom in the dim glow of an
outside lamp under the station platform covering.
After one or two futile efforts Arden managed to push
back the door and enter.</p>
<p>The ticket and telegraph office was faintly lighted,
but as Arden looked in through the little window,
protected by a wicket of brass, she could not make
out the form of the agent she was sure she had seen
when she peered in from the outside platform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; worried the girl. &ldquo;He must have gone
out, and before he comes back to take my message,
someone from the college may stop in here and catch
me. That&rsquo;s the worst of these country places. I suppose
there isn&rsquo;t another train for some time and the
agent went out for a rest. If I could only reach in and
get a telegraph blank I could write the message, with
a notation to send it collect, and leave it here for him.
Let&rsquo;s see&mdash;what shall I say? &lsquo;Must have a thousand
dollars at once. Can you send it? Letter follows.&rsquo; Dad
will probably think I&rsquo;ve embezzled some of the college
funds or stolen some jewels. Oh, where is that agent?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>She drummed impatiently with a pencil on the shelf
of the window and stood on tiptoes to look in. As she
did so the agent suddenly emerged from where he was
crouched low in a stooping position halfway into a
small supply closet in one corner of his cubbyhole of an
office, out of Arden&rsquo;s sight. The agent stood up so
quickly, directly in front of the wicket window confronting
Arden, that it was as if some gigantic Jack-in-the-box
had popped out at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she gasped, preventing herself, by a strong
effort, from springing back. Then again, but less hysterically:
&ldquo;Oh, here you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked the agent and he smiled.</p>
<p>Arden opened her mouth to say she wanted to send
a telegram, but the sudden appearance of the man,
popping up into her view in that manner, was so disconcerting
that she could only stand there and stare at
him. And as she stared she realized, with a shock,
that she had seen the face of this man somewhere
before. She stood there, silent and perplexed, trying to
solve the puzzle, trying to remember. Could she have
seen the man before?</p>
<p>He stood patiently waiting for her to state her
wants.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>But Arden went into a strange panic of fear and uncertainty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I think I&rsquo;ve forgotten something!&rdquo; she gasped,
backing nervously away from the window. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
come back&mdash;later.&rdquo; She forced to her face a rather
sickly smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the man behind the wicket. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
be open for quite a while yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, turning away, Arden fled, pulled open the
door, scurried across the tracks and rushed back to
college. Her one thought was to bring Terry and Sim
with her to the station on a strange errand. She wanted
them to help her identify the man in the ticket office
as the missing Pangborn heir, pictured on the placard
in the post office.</p>
<p>For that was exactly what Arden believed. So obsessed
had she become with the poster picture and the
reward offered for information about the original,
that she was sure she was right.</p>
<p>The man who had popped up at the wicket window
was Harry Pangborn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m positive of it!&rdquo; murmured Arden as she ran
faster. &ldquo;But I must get Sim and Terry to look at him.
I&rsquo;ll need their evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><br />CHAPTER XVII
<br />In Danger</h2>
<p>With startling suddenness, the night, aided by the
dense fog, settled down over Cedar Ridge. Arden was
alarmed. She had not thought it was so late, though
she was quite sure the supper bell had not yet rung.
She ran faster, her beating heart keeping time with her
pattering feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope Terry and Sim will come back with me
and see this for themselves,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;How wonderful
that I have made this discovery! I need not wire
Dad for that money after all. I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; she tried to
convince herself, &ldquo;that I am right. Quite sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no time to be lost. Supper would soon
be served and the three from 513 dared not be absent
from their places at the table very long. Nor would
they want to be. Appetites were remarkably keen at
the college, in spite of all the mystery and excitement
and notwithstanding the eating that was done between
meals.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>As Arden approached the main building which
loomed up out of the fog like some dream castle, she
called on her childhood friend, the &ldquo;good fairy.&rdquo; She
murmured: &ldquo;Good fairy, please don&rsquo;t let us get caught,
and for a wish, I wish that Terry and Sim will come
back with me right away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed the good fairy did not entirely desert her
child, for, as Arden started up the stairs, she met her
two chums coming down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terry! Sim! I&rsquo;ve the most exciting thing to tell
you!&rdquo; Arden gulped and continued: &ldquo;Come outside a
moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens! You look as if you&rsquo;d seen a ghost!
Take a breath&mdash;or something&mdash;before you pass out!&rdquo;
advised Terry, a little incredulous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, tell us, Arden!&rdquo; Sim begged, wringing her
hands in simulated melodramatic fashion. &ldquo;This suspense
is awful! It&rsquo;s making an old woman of me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want anyone to hear,&rdquo; Arden confided.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you step outside for a few seconds? You won&rsquo;t
be cold. I want you to do something for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sim and Terry looked at each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better humor her, Sim. She might turn violent.
Come on,&rdquo; Terry said in an exaggerated attempt at
soothing a patient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I get violent it will be because you two show
such little natural curiosity, Bernice Westover,&rdquo; Arden
retorted testily. &ldquo;When you hear what I saw&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can we <i>hear</i> what you <i>saw</i>?&rdquo; mocked Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Arden, really provoked now.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, my dear.&rdquo; Terry held open the main
entrance door and motioned the other two out ahead
of her. &ldquo;If anyone wonders why we are going out
when the supper bell has almost rung, we can say we
want a breath of fresh air for an appetite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if anyone who knows the feed here would believe
that!&rdquo; mocked Sim.</p>
<p>But in spite of the banter, Arden finally herded her
chums down to the cinder path in front of the dormitory
building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along a little farther,&rdquo; she urged. &ldquo;No one
must hear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terry and Sim followed, now really convinced that
Arden had something of moment to impart to them.
She looked around half in caution, half in fear. When
they were some distance from the main entrance and
shrouded in the fog, Arden said in a low voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just over to the station&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were!&rdquo; interrupted Sim. &ldquo;Why, Arden Blake!
If you were seen, it&rsquo;ll be just too bad! What if Tiddy
finds out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. But there are times when rules have
to be broken,&rdquo; admitted Arden. &ldquo;If George Washington
and Thomas Jefferson or some historic personages
like that hadn&rsquo;t drafted a new constitution in Philadelphia
when they had no right to do so, I wouldn&rsquo;t be
telling you all this.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All what? That you were over to the station? It&rsquo;s
a grand night to break rules but a better one for
murders,&rdquo; declared Terry, sniffing the fog with her
head thrown back and her eyes half shut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;d stop interrupting I could tell you.&rdquo; Arden
was beginning to lose patience. &ldquo;I was over at the
station, as I said, and I saw someone there: the night
ticket agent, who is the very image of the missing
man whose picture we saw on the reward notice in
the post office! There!&rdquo; Arden paused to see what
effect this statement had on her friends. They seemed
to take it very calmly, and Terry said, most practically:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Arden. If he was the man you think he
is, someone else would have noticed him long ago and
claimed the reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; added Sim, &ldquo;no young man, or old one
either, who wanted to keep his whereabouts secret
would be so foolish as to appear in so public a place
as a railroad ticket office, and near the place where
there was hanging a poster offering a thousand dollars
for information about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not necessarily,&rdquo; countered Arden calmly. &ldquo;I have
read somewhere that the cleverest criminals (not that
Mr. Pangborn is one, though) always stay right in
the place where they have committed a crime or are
supposed to have vanished from. The trick is, that
no one ever thinks of looking so near home for them.
Poe has a story about a missing letter that was all the
while right in the open, stuck in a rack with a lot of
others.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, we had to read that in English lit,&rdquo; admitted
Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you want to do, Sherlock&mdash;go over
and identify the corpse?&rdquo; asked Sim. &ldquo;If you do, I&rsquo;m
afraid I can&rsquo;t come. I have to go to Mary Todd for
a notebook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, Sim, it won&rsquo;t take a minute, or only two or
three, anyhow. You can come right back and be in
time for supper. Think how thrilling it would be
if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It most likely won&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; finished Terry. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m
game. I like fog. It&rsquo;s good for the complexion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you and Terry go, I&rsquo;ll come, too, of course. But
I think you&rsquo;re on a wild-goose chase,&rdquo; declared Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I tell you he looked exactly like the poster!&rdquo;
affirmed Arden. &ldquo;I stood here looking at him, with
my mouth open like a fish, while he waited for me to
speak. I was so surprised I just had to stammer something
about forgetting what I came for, say I&rsquo;d be
back later, and run away. I don&rsquo;t know what he
thought of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he can&rsquo;t think. Anyhow, come on, Sim. But
make it snappy. I&rsquo;ve got something else to do more
important than this,&rdquo; said Terry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>Arm in arm the three girls, a little nervous when
they realized what would happen if they were caught
breaking the campus rule in effect against them,
started for the station. Arden hurried them impatiently,
but Terry was in one of her teasing moods
and refused to be hastened, pausing now and then to
remark on the beauty of the night and attempting to
point out, in the dense fog, places of interest on their
brief journey.</p>
<p>At the station a quick look through an end window
showed the waiting room to be unoccupied except for
a man standing near the big white pot-stove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is&mdash;the agent!&rdquo; whispered Arden. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
come out of his coop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d think he was a chicken!&rdquo; chuckled Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, be quiet!&rdquo; Arden begged. &ldquo;Now you two go
in and look at him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you coming?&rdquo; asked Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;ll wait outside here. I don&rsquo;t want him to
see me again. You two go in. Get a good look at him.
Ask for&mdash;for time-tables. Oh, I&rsquo;m so excited!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so nervous,&rdquo; Terry admonished. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
be so disappointed if you&rsquo;re wrong. However&mdash;come
on, Sim!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terry and Sim, with none of the reluctance Arden
was sure she would have experienced, marched around
to the door. Arden drew back into the shadows of the
fog and waited. She heard her chums enter, dimly
heard the murmurs of their voices as, presumably, they
asked for time-tables and caught the squeak of the
door hinges again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d she go?&rdquo; Terry murmured. Evidently
she and Sim could not see the hidden Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope this isn&rsquo;t her idea of a joke, to get us here
and then run back,&rdquo; grumbled Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! Here I am!&rdquo; exclaimed Arden, coming
forth out of the gloom. &ldquo;Did you&mdash;was he&mdash;is
he&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arden, my pet,&rdquo; began Terry, flipping a damp
time-table, &ldquo;we fear for your reason, we, your devoted
friends. That agent looks no more like the
picture of Harry Pangborn than you do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; gasped Arden. &ldquo;I thought he was the very
image of the poster picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, Arden,&rdquo; Sim continued. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll have to
do better than this to claim the reward. That&rsquo;s that,
and as I&rsquo;m dripping with dampness, I&rsquo;m going back
where it&rsquo;s light and dry and warm and where I can
eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, let&rsquo;s go back!&rdquo; agreed Terry, feeling a little
sorry for Arden.</p>
<p>Arden looked sadly at her chums. &ldquo;And I was
almost sure,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think there&rsquo;s
a small, a tiny resemblance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the slightest!&rdquo; chorused Terry and Sim.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, we must get back, I suppose. But I
certainly feel like a balloon that has suddenly lost its
gas.&rdquo; Arden sighed.</p>
<p>Slowly the three started down the station platform
to the walk that led across the tracks and on to the
college. As they were about to leave the shadowy
shelter of the overhanging roof, Arden, who was in
the lead, reached back two cautioning and restraining
hands toward Terry and Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; they asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye gods! Here comes Henny&mdash;our reverend chaplain!
He mustn&rsquo;t see us here at this hour! Oh, what
shall we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arden was in a panic of fear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><br />CHAPTER XVIII
<br />In Hiding</h2>
<p>The tall, slim figure, like a black ghost in the white
fog, was approaching with measured stride, characteristic
of Rev. Dr. Henry Bordmust.</p>
<p>The three girls, toward whom he was unwittingly
walking, looked wildly around for a place to hide. The
platform was clear except for some benches, now holding
only dripping fog drops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inside&mdash;quickly! Perhaps he won&rsquo;t notice us!&rdquo;
whispered Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he will, though, and we mustn&rsquo;t take a
chance!&rdquo; objected Terry. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget, we&rsquo;re over
here without permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forward stalked the tall black figure, splitting the
fog into damp, swirling masses of mist as he trudged
along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, girls!&rdquo; hissed Sim. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s almost here!
We can hide in the baggage room at the end of the
station.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>Quickly the girls scurried around the corner of the
building toward the baggage room. Fortunately the
door was open. Inside, showing beneath a small incandescent
lamp, hung high, festooned with cobwebs and
dust, were several trunks, valises, suitcases, and boxes.
Some of the pieces of baggage and express seemed to
have been forgotten, uncalled for or lost a long time.
Dust was thick on them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t very bright,&rdquo; whispered Terry. Which was
true. The high little light only made the gloomy
shadows and corners more gloomy. &ldquo;I wonder if there
are rats here?&rdquo; Terry breathed in alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; gasped Arden. &ldquo;Why do you have to think
of things like that? Stop it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; cautioned Sim. &ldquo;I hear footsteps coming
this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut the door!&rdquo; begged Terry.</p>
<p>Arden pushed it so that it was almost tight in the
frame. There it stuck. It would close no farther.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;The light will show
around the cracks and the sill. We can&rsquo;t shut it off.
Oh, what&rsquo;ll we do? If he comes in here he&rsquo;ll be sure
to see us. We were better off outside. Then we could
run and vanish in the fog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may not come in here,&rdquo; spoke Sim hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but he&rsquo;s coming&mdash;or someone is&mdash;right this
way!&rdquo; gasped Terry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>They were in real panic now&mdash;fluttering about seeking
concealment. Once Arden and Terry bumped together
in their mad race around the little room, but
they hadn&rsquo;t a giggle among them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&mdash;in here!&rdquo; Sim suddenly hissed from a
distant corner. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found some kind of a big packing
box with a hinged cover like a trapdoor. We can hide
in that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we all get in?&rdquo; asked Terry. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to
be left standing outside like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we can make it,&rdquo; Sim answered. &ldquo;We must
try, anyhow. Here, Arden&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She held out her
hand, and Arden grasped it. &ldquo;Now, Terry! I&rsquo;ll guide
you. It&rsquo;s very dark in this corner, but I can make out
the box. I&rsquo;ll climb in first and you two follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terry and Arden half heard, half saw Sim partly
climb and partly fall over the side of a great box in
one corner of the dim room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Arden,&rdquo; Sim urged. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arden put one leg over the side and raised herself
up by her hands as if climbing a fence. As she did so
there was a ripping, tearing sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good stocking and part of my leg, too! Oh,
dear!&rdquo; lamented Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get in quickly. Never mind about that!&rdquo; urged
Sim. &ldquo;All right. Cuddle down. Now, Terry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, this is awful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk! Climb in! Shrink a little, Arden!&rdquo;
commanded Sim. &ldquo;She thinks she&rsquo;s in bed and taking
more than her half.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not!&rdquo; Arden affirmed. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll shrink all I
can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; voiced Sim. &ldquo;Now, Terry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here I come! Oh! Oh!&rdquo; Her voice indicated
lamenting terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Sim wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see out through the crack in the door. The
station agent is headed right for this place, and Henny
is with him. Oh, they&rsquo;ll find us, sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if we stoop down and keep still!&rdquo; declared
Sim. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you come in, Terry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t! I&rsquo;m caught&mdash;or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, pull yourself loose! You&rsquo;ve just got to!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here goes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the ripping, tearing sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My best skirt on a big nail!&rdquo; sighed Terry. Then
she flopped over the side and down upon Sim and
Arden.</p>
<p>Despite the discomfort of their positions and the
imminent danger of detection, Terry began to giggle.
It was quickly infectious, and Arden and Sim held
grimy hands over their mouths to stifle the dangerous
sounds of hysterical mirth.</p>
<p>They could hear the voices of the chaplain and the
station agent just outside the baggage-room door.
They were surely coming in, the girls thought, though
whether to detect the culprits or for some other reason
could not yet be determined.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>Suddenly Sim reached up and pulled down the
large, hinged cover of the packing case. It was light
but strongly made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll smother!&rdquo; protested Arden in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we won&rsquo;t! There are plenty of cracks for air,&rdquo;
said Sim.</p>
<p>Hardly was the cover down, shutting the girls inside
the now very dark case, than the door of the baggage
room was pushed open and, through cracks in the
packing case the girls could see Rev. Dr. Henry Bordmust,
dressed neatly in black, step in ahead of the
agent in his blue coat with brass buttons. With the
two men wisps of fog drifted into the room.</p>
<p>In the closeness of the box, Arden tried vainly to
push Sim&rsquo;s left elbow away from her ribs. Terry was
slowly settling down, half on Arden, with her legs
twisted around Sim&rsquo;s neck. Sim had the best position,
as she was the smallest. Her eyes were on a level with
a crack between the lid and the top edge of the box.
She squinted to accustom her eyesight to the dimly
lighted room. She saw the chaplain looking at a tag
on a worn and dusty trunk.</p>
<p>The reason for his visit now seemed obvious. He
wasn&rsquo;t after the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any trace of that trunk of mine yet?&rdquo;
asked the chaplain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the agent answered, following
the example of the clergyman and looking at several
labels on various pieces of baggage. &ldquo;But that there
trunk ought to be around some place, if it was shipped
when you say it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it was shipped when I say it was!&rdquo; testily
replied the Rev. Henry. &ldquo;Why would I say it was if
it wasn&rsquo;t, my good man? This is the third or fourth
time I&rsquo;ve been over here looking for it. I&rsquo;ve been expecting
it over a week now. Come, be a little quicker!
You ought to be able to find it for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I am looking. It might have got over in
behind this here packing case. Lots of things get
behind these cases. They are shipped up here filled
with raw silk for the factory over at Tumeville. But
sometimes the drivers take the silk out here and leave
the empty cases to be shipped back. I&rsquo;ll have a look
back of this case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With hearts that beat faster than ever, the girls
could look through the cracks in their prison and see
the agent approaching their hiding place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody musta left this case unfastened when
they emptied it,&rdquo; muttered the agent. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s dangerous,
with the nails sticking out of the cover like the way
they do. I&rsquo;ll tap &rsquo;em in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With an iron weight from the platform scale near
him, the man hammered down the nails projecting
from the lower side of the lid into the front rim of
the box.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>He had nailed the girls in! With just a couple of
whacks!</p>
<p>Hardly daring to breathe, lest they betray their
presence, Arden, Terry, and Sim listened speechless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope, nothing behind this case &rsquo;ceptin&rsquo; some old
valises nobody ever called for,&rdquo; reported the agent,
peering behind the big box after his nailing work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about this pile of trunks?&rdquo; asked the chaplain,
his voice, this time, coming from a distant corner
of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you look there, sir, but I don&rsquo;t believe
what you want&rsquo;s there,&rdquo; the agent replied, as he shuffled
away.</p>
<p>The girls breathed more freely, and Sim hoarsely
whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens! We&rsquo;re nailed in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Arden! What a pickle you got us into!&rdquo;
gasped Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! They&rsquo;ll hear us! Wait until Henry goes
out,&rdquo; counseled Arden. &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll try to force the
cover up with our shoulders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a sudden silence as the agent and the
clergyman peered at another pile of trunks. The girls
could hear their hearts beating and Terry, interested
in the phenomenon, inquired cautiously whether it was
Sim&rsquo;s heart she heard or her own.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your own, silly!&rdquo; replied Sim. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost
smothered! I wish they&rsquo;d go out so we could breathe!
Don&rsquo;t hiss so; they&rsquo;ll hear you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That there trunk of your&rsquo;n might have got over
in th&rsquo; freight office by mistake,&rdquo; said the agent.
&ldquo;S&rsquo;posin&rsquo; we look there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we do,&rdquo; agreed the chaplain, who was fast
losing what little patience he had.</p>
<p>Then the two men left the baggage room, and on
his way out the agent pulled the switch controlling the
dim and dirty ceiling light.</p>
<p>The imprisoned girls were left in darkness!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><br />CHAPTER XIX
<br />Strange Talk</h2>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; remarked Terry disgustedly, as the
agent pulled the door of the baggage room shut and
his footsteps and those of the chaplain died away in
faint echoes, &ldquo;it seems to me that we just get into one
scrape after another. This is a pretty kettle of fish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or something!&rdquo; gloomily agreed Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you turn around so you can be sort of on your
hands and knees?&rdquo; asked Arden, ignoring Terry&rsquo;s remark.
&ldquo;Try it. Sim and I will squeeze away over to
one side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oooff!&rdquo; grunted Terry as she attempted to change
her position. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost over! Don&rsquo;t mind if you get
a black eye, Sim. It will only be from my elbow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall mind, though, so you&rsquo;d better fold up your
arms. There! She&rsquo;s over, Arden. Now I&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo; said
Sim.</p>
<p>Sim accomplished the feat more easily than had
Terry, and then Arden did it. All kneeling, they braced
with their legs and arms, arched up their backs, and
tried to force off the nailed lid of the packing case.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Heave!&rdquo; exclaimed Arden, having heard this expression
used by the foreman of a gang of section men
on the railroad near the college grounds. &ldquo;Heave
hard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All together they raised their backs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ouch! That doesn&rsquo;t do any good! We&rsquo;re in here
for the night unless someone comes back to release
us!&rdquo; groaned Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rest a minute,&rdquo; advised Arden. &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll try it
again. Once more&mdash;all heave!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the second try only made the box shift a little
on its base.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must make some noise! Bang on the sides or
yell or scream! We must get out of here!&rdquo; Arden was
getting desperate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! Hey!&rdquo; shouted Terry. &ldquo;Come back! Let us
out! We&rsquo;re smothering! Hey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurray! Hurray!&rdquo; screamed Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you cheering for?&rdquo; demanded Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t a cheer. But I can make my voice
carry farther that way than any other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help! Help! Help!&rdquo; appealed Arden shrilly.</p>
<p>They listened, their hearts beating fast from fear
and the exertion of shouting. They thought they heard
footsteps approaching.</p>
<p>Then, by the rays of light streaming through the
fog from the station platform, as they peered out of
the cracks in the box, they could see the door of the
baggage room flung open. Near it stood the agent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s alone, thank goodness!&rdquo; said Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help!&rdquo; cried Arden again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us out!&rdquo; shouted Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fer th&rsquo; love of cats, who are you? Where are
you?&rdquo; exclaimed the agent, for the voices were muffled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this packing case! You nailed us in!&rdquo; answered
Arden.</p>
<p>With a muttered expression of great surprise, the
agent picked up the same scale weight he had used to
drive the nails partly in, and by pounding on the lower
edge of the cover he forced it up, flung it back, and
let the rays of the overhead light, which he had
switched on, flood upon the three disheveled girls in
the big box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sakes!&rdquo; cried the man. &ldquo;What are you girls
doin&rsquo; in there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shut us in,&rdquo; Sim answered, standing up and
stretching, as did her chums. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t want Dr.
Bordmust to see us, so we hid in this box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; continued Terry, &ldquo;you nailed it shut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was I t&rsquo; know you was in there?&rdquo; demanded
the agent, with much justification. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lucky thing,
after Dr. Bordmust left, not finding what he was
after, that I come back here t&rsquo; make sure I&rsquo;d switched
off the light for th&rsquo; night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very lucky,&rdquo; agreed Sim.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I never could of heard you yellin&rsquo; once I got back
t&rsquo; my office,&rdquo; went on the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re awfully glad you came here. Thanks, so
much!&rdquo; murmured Terry, with much relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where you from&mdash;Cedar Ridge?&rdquo; asked the
agent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Arden answered, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;re in an awful
hurry to get back. Supper must have started,&rdquo; she
told her chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; sighed Sim. &ldquo;I only hope there&rsquo;s some
left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll explain to you another time,&rdquo; continued
Arden. &ldquo;Come on, girls!&rdquo; she urged.</p>
<p>The girls, a trifle stiff from their cramped positions,
climbed over the side of the box. This time there were
no ripping or tearing accidents. The agent stared uncomprehendingly
at the trio as they landed on the
floor of the baggage room and shook their garments
into some semblance of order. Then they hurried out,
Sim flinging back a perfunctory but none the less sincere
&ldquo;thank you,&rdquo; as they pushed past the agent and
again went out into the cold, damp fog.</p>
<p>As they hurried along the platform they heard the
agent muttering to himself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll them girls do next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old air!&rdquo; breathed Terry as they ran along.
&ldquo;I never thought it could be so welcome, even all
messed up with fog as it is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We were very lucky to get out,&rdquo; murmured Sim.
&ldquo;Suppose he hadn&rsquo;t come back and no one ever found
us until years later, when we&rsquo;d be only skeletons!
What a scandal for the college!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very cheerful, Sim,&rdquo; replied Arden. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re
late again and we shall just have to dash back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never did so much dashing in my whole life. I&rsquo;m
always running to some place or hurrying away from
it, by golly!&rdquo; complained Terry. &ldquo;Tomorrow I&rsquo;m going
to take time out and just <i>sit</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t sit now. It&rsquo;s almost supper time, if
not already past it. One more last dash for dear old
Cedar Ridge!&rdquo; pleaded Arden. &ldquo;Be a sport, Terry. I
know it was all my fault. But I&rsquo;ll translate your
French to make up for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the girls dashed through the pea-soup fog toward
the college. They went around to the rear door, where
they would be less likely to be seen. A few yards ahead
of them, as they reached the college grounds, as far
as they could see through the swirling mist, were two
dim figures. Arden and her chums slackened their
pace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Henny talking to someone!&rdquo; gasped Sim.
&ldquo;Compose yourselves, girls. Be very demure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he doesn&rsquo;t stop us,&rdquo; Terry remarked. &ldquo;Who
is he talking to&mdash;or should I say &lsquo;whom&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should say &lsquo;whom,&rsquo;&rdquo; declared Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyhow, I said it,&rdquo; countered Terry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I knew what you meant,&rdquo; responded Arden. &ldquo;But
look!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Henny talking to Tom
Scott, the gardener?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is,&rdquo; said Sim.</p>
<p>Composing themselves, the three girls walked at an
ordinary pace along the shrubbery-lined path that led
to the rear door of the dining hall. The chaplain and
the young gardener were in earnest conversation,
somewhat off the path on the edge of a large round
flower bed. Just as the three reached the two men, who
did not seem aware of their approach, the girls could
hear the Rev. Henry ask, somewhat crossly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much longer are you going to keep this up?
It&rsquo;s dangerous! I don&rsquo;t like it at all. I am almost
resolved&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just give me a little longer chance,&rdquo; pleaded the
other. &ldquo;I have almost settled it. I&rsquo;ll see you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Tom Scott faded away in the fog and darkness,
and the chaplain, muttering something the girls
could not catch, turned back toward his own residence
near the chapel.</p>
<p>Now he caught sight of the girls, and turning
toward them, and by doing so disturbing more wisps
of the swirling fog, he greeted them in his most
benign manner with:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-evening, young ladies! Walking in the fog?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dr. Bordmust, we like it,&rdquo; answered Arden,
with a great assumption of innocence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hum&mdash;er&mdash;yes,&rdquo; mumbled Henny. &ldquo;Though it
isn&rsquo;t good for old throats,&rdquo; and coughing raspingly,
he swung on his way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s lucky!&rdquo; exclaimed Terry as they hurried
on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose they were talking about?&rdquo;
asked Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if we could guess,&rdquo; sighed Sim. &ldquo;But I know
one thing,&rdquo; she added as they slipped in at the door,
&ldquo;if that agent at the station doesn&rsquo;t tell anyone what
happened, we&rsquo;re all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, freshies!&rdquo; exclaimed a voice close to them.
&ldquo;Rather late to be coming back from the station, isn&rsquo;t
it? I was behind you all the way from the post office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three whirled around. The speaker was Jessica
Darglan, smiling sardonically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;that you three were
campused. But that&rsquo;s your worry,&rdquo; and she brushed
past them and went into the dining hall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><br />CHAPTER XX
<br />A Dire Threat</h2>
<p>&ldquo;If Jessica Darglan tells where she saw us,&rdquo; said
Terry, next morning, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re sunk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t. Nobody could be so mean,&rdquo; remarked
Arden as she combed her hair in front of the bureau.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never can tell, Arden,&rdquo; supplemented Sim.
&ldquo;Some people take a positive delight in doing things
like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing we can do about it, even if she
does. So we won&rsquo;t worry until we get a notice to go see
Tiddy,&rdquo; decided Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant to ask you after supper last night,&rdquo; began
Arden, &ldquo;did you two think any more about what
Henny was saying to Tom Scott as we came along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t pay much attention,&rdquo; confessed Sim. &ldquo;I
was too busy being demure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; went on Arden, &ldquo;he said something about
it being dangerous and asked Tom Scott how long he
was going to keep it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sort of funny,&rdquo; admitted Terry. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the
second time we have heard those two talking together.
I wonder what it all means?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t worry me much,&rdquo; declared Sim as she
pulled on her stockings. &ldquo;Because I think I&rsquo;ll go home
the way I planned in a few days. I&rsquo;ll leave before I&rsquo;m
expelled for going out while campused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Sim! Do we have to go over all that again?&rdquo;
pleaded Arden. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you stick it out? If we have to
be expelled, let&rsquo;s all go home together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go, Sim,&rdquo; begged Terry. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just beginning
to enjoy it here. You know, deep down in your
heart, that last night in the station was fun, even if it
was uncomfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk about it later,&rdquo; answered Sim. &ldquo;I have
an early class this morning. See you when I get back.&rdquo;
She gathered up her books, gave a last look in the
glass, and hurried down to breakfast without waiting
for her friends.</p>
<p>Back in 513, Arden and Terry went on with their
dressing. If Sim felt like being alone, it was wise to
let her go. They would see her at breakfast, anyhow.</p>
<p>But at the table Sim devoted herself to Jane Randall
and seemed deliberately to be avoiding her roommates.
For, as she finished her meal, Sim linked arms
with Jane and started for Bordmust Hall, leaving
Terry and Arden by themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sim is in one of her moods,&rdquo; remarked Arden as
she swung along beside Terry. &ldquo;But she&rsquo;ll forget all
about it by lunch time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s awfully disappointed about the pool.
And being campused, while it doesn&rsquo;t make a great
deal of difference, just rubs Sim the wrong way. She
hates to feel that she is being persecuted,&rdquo; observed
Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t bother me a bit,&rdquo; declared Arden. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
keeping occupied by trying to straighten out this mystery
and get the reward money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have an even disposition,&rdquo; suggested Terry.
&ldquo;We are not all as lucky as you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terry sighed deeply and shifted her books from her
right arm to her left. Arden and she trudged silently
along up the hill to Bordmust Hall.</p>
<p>The fog of the night before had blown away, and
the distant hills shimmered in a soft blue light. The
leaves were beginning to fall, and at the steps of
Bordmust the head gardener, Anson Yaeger, was
raking the lawn with sullen viciousness.</p>
<p>As the girls reached him he stopped moving the
rake and looked at them penetratingly. His little beady
eyes narrowed into bright slits. Resting part of his
weight on the rake he shook a grimy finger at the
freshmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re two of them girls I seen down in my
orchard!&rdquo; he snarled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no right there! Mark
my words, no good will come of it! And don&rsquo;t concern
yourselves with what&rsquo;s none of your business. There&rsquo;s
things going on around here that nobody knows about
but me. I wouldn&rsquo;t like to see you hurt, foolish as you
are!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>Terry and Arden stood dumbfounded. Completely
taken by surprise, they moved on past the surly gardener
and involuntarily looked back at him without
attempting to answer him.</p>
<p>The heavy, thickset man in tattered overalls and an
old-fashioned, gray coat-sweater looked over his shoulder
with wild eyes, as though expecting someone to
come along and stop his tirade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I was to tell you all I know,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;what
with alarm bells ringing and all, you&rsquo;d pack up and
take the next train home. Why, last night&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terry nudged Arden, murmuring:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s stand here like a couple of ninnies and
let him talk to us this way. Come on! I think he&rsquo;s a
little crazy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arden pulled away from Terry. &ldquo;But I want to hear
what he&rsquo;s saying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anson heard them whispering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heedless young things!&rdquo; he scolded. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be
sorry if you don&rsquo;t do as I say.&rdquo; Turning abruptly, he
picked up the rake that had slipped to the ground and
shuffled off through the rustling leaves in the direction
of the orchard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, you see!&rdquo; exclaimed Arden. &ldquo;I told you
there was something weird down in that old orchard!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a good mind to follow him and see where he&rsquo;s
going,&rdquo; said Terry. &ldquo;What do you say, Arden, to a
little more sleuthing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m game,&rdquo; Arden answered. But even as she spoke
the electric bell in Bordmust Hall announced the beginning
of the first classes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t go now,&rdquo; said Terry. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to let
it wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Arden reluctantly.</p>
<p>The two girls entered the building, having a last
glimpse of the mysterious gardener still shuffling his
way through the rustling leaves toward the orchard
where so many strange things had happened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><br />CHAPTER XXI
<br />A Bold Stroke</h2>
<p>With great difficulty Arden concentrated on her
French literature. Daudet&rsquo;s &ldquo;My Old Mill,&rdquo; seemed
very silly and unnecessary. Who cared about a sleepy
French town, drowsing under a provincial sun? A real
present-day mystery story would have been much more
interesting and to the point.</p>
<p>Twice Mademoiselle cautioned Arden to pay more
attention and finally called upon her to translate aloud.
Arden arose and stumbled through two paragraphs
which she had known perfectly the night before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do, Mees Blake,&rdquo; drawled the gentle
Frenchwoman. &ldquo;Eet is obvious you have not prepared
ze assignment. You will please geeve me a written
translation, tomorrow morning, of today&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mademoiselle,&rdquo; gulped Arden and sat down.</p>
<p>The events of the last few days were too much for
even the conscientious Arden. She simply could not put
her mind on the lesson but sat looking as though all
that mattered in her life was the charming essay the
girls were studying. In reality, however, Arden&rsquo;s mind
was far away from the little mill town.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>While her classmates went on with their somewhat
halting translations, Arden decided on a bold stroke.
In her free period, directly after mathematics, she
would go alone over to town and hurry to the police
station. There she would inquire as to the latest developments
of the Pangborn case. If there was nothing
to be learned no one would be the wiser for her daring
escapade. For escapade it was, viewed in the fact that
she was campused: forbidden to leave the precincts of
Cedar Ridge.</p>
<p>Suddenly Arden felt something of a thrill go
through her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo; she exclaimed impulsively and half
aloud. Then she looked very foolish as her classmates
stared wonderingly at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mees Blake, you are behaving very strangely today,&rdquo;
said the French teacher. &ldquo;Please compose yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arden shook her head as if in compliance and
smiled weakly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what that gardener, Anson, was talking
about?&rdquo; she mused. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he knows what strange
mystery is in the orchard, anyway.&rdquo; Mentally she reviewed
the startling happenings since she and her
chums had come to Cedar Ridge. It was all so puzzling.
On wings of thought Arden flew over to the
little stone building in town&mdash;Police Headquarters.
Boldly entering, she announced to the officer in charge
her solution of the baffling case of the missing heir
and claimed the reward and then, in triumph, presented
it to the dean for the repair of the swimming
pool so Sim would remain in college.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All a daydream, though,&rdquo; murmured Arden.</p>
<p>As the bell rang, marking the end of the French
period, Arden recovered herself with a start. Quickly
gathering up her books and papers, she hurried to her
class in mathematics.</p>
<p>This was worse than the preceding session. Now
she was absolutely unable to concentrate in the least.
Her poor brain whirled with visions of geometric
figures punctuated with policemen in the disguise of
gardeners. She flunked miserably and heard, with a
sigh of relief, the ringing of the bell for which she
had waited so impatiently.</p>
<p>When the mathematics class was dismissed, Arden
left hurriedly, for once getting away without Sim or
Terry. She took a short cut across the hockey field and
crawled through a hole in the hedge after a hasty and
fearsome glance backward to observe if anyone might
be observing her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, anyhow,&rdquo; she sighed with relief.</p>
<p>This route brought her much nearer her destination.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>Arden hastened along the peaceful main street of
the suburban town still clutching her books. In front
of a two-story building of mellowed red bricks, partly
overgrown with dull green and bronzed ivy, she
stopped. Two bright green lamps on each side of the
doorway were in readiness to leap into emerald illumination
of the sign POLICE HEADQUARTERS
which caught and held her attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dare I go in?&rdquo; she mused.</p>
<p>She dared. Gathering together all her courage, she
opened the heavy door, its knob of bright brass, and
entered. Inside a rather large bare room all was
serene. The dark wooden floor was scrubbed immaculately
clean. Behind a heavy desk of light oak, around
which high lights played on a glaring brass rail of
heavy proportions, a man was reading a paper. Arden
could see him around one end of the desk, his two
thick-soled shoes elevated and his hands holding the
paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&mdash;a-hem!&rdquo; she coughed when, after several seconds,
he did not seem aware of her presence.</p>
<p>With a rustle of surprise the paper was lowered,
displaying a red-faced middle-aged man who looked
considerably startled. When he noticed Arden he lowered
his feet from the desk and tried to look business-like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear you come in, young lady,&rdquo; he began.
&ldquo;What can I do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; Arden replied. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to
startle you.&rdquo; To gain time to think, she remarked
about the beauty of the morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very nice day,&rdquo; agreed the chief, for it was the
head of the small country department whom Arden
had intruded upon: a fact she observed when he
donned his cap, officially, and buttoned his gilt braid-encrusted
coat, which gaped wide open. He arose and
stood at attention behind the desk, smiling as he
asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there something I can do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;yes. That is&mdash;you see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Arden was
quite flustered. But gaining control of herself she began
again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am at school&mdash;Cedar Ridge. The college, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chief nodded helpfully, and a little look of
wonder came over his face. It was seldom he came in
contact with the college girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw a circular in the post office, across from the
college,&rdquo; went on Arden. &ldquo;It was about a man named
Harry Pangborn, who is missing and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; interrupted the chief, very interested
now. &ldquo;The Pangborn poster&mdash;the place is full of them.
Missing person posters. We put them up in public
places and sometimes forget to take them down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arden felt something of a chill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Are they so old, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some are. What did you want to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That one about Harry Pangborn.&rdquo; Couldn&rsquo;t the
chief have heard the name at first?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, without much encouragement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It says a thousand dollars reward,&rdquo; Arden reminded
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a moment.&rdquo; He smiled at her from behind
his heavy desk, a safe breastwork, and went to a filing
cabinet. Running his fingers along the tops of a row
of cards he brought out one that had a poster fastened
to it. &ldquo;Is this the one?&rdquo; he asked, holding it out to
Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve seen that
man&rsquo;s face somewhere around here&mdash;in town, perhaps.
Don&rsquo;t you know anything about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum! No, not much. That&rsquo;s rather an old and
dead case. We haven&rsquo;t much to go on about him. I
don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ve seen <i>him</i>. If he was around here
any place, you can be sure we&rsquo;d have apprehended him
and claimed the reward ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; murmured Arden, rather dismayed. &ldquo;Then
you don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a chance that I might have seen
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a bare chance, of course. But you want to
make pretty sure before you turn a man in as a person
missing and for whom a reward is offered. False arrest
or detention is rather a serious charge, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know; that is, I suppose it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dispirited, Arden looked down at her dusty oxfords.
Another of her cherished plans had fallen
through. She took a long breath and, looking at the
chief again, remarked:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, thank you&mdash;very much. I must get back to
class now.&rdquo; She turned to leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a moment!&rdquo; called the chief rather sharply.
&ldquo;Why are you so interested in this man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course.&rdquo; Arden smiled disarmingly. &ldquo;Only
just so I might claim the reward if I found him and
have our college pool repaired. The swimming pool,
you know. It&rsquo;s broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; encouraged the chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. It seemed like a good way to get the money.
A friend of mine is awfully disappointed that she can&rsquo;t
swim. I mean she can swim, but with the pool broken
she can&rsquo;t, and so I was trying to help and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arden was at the end of her resources. She turned
and fled&mdash;beat a most undignified retreat as she told
herself later. But the chief was not so easily disposed
of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a moment!&rdquo; he called rather sharply, and
came out from behind the desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; gasped Arden to herself. &ldquo;Is he going to
arrest me&mdash;detain me for questioning just because I
have asked about the poster? If he does&mdash;what a terrible
disgrace on top of what has already happened
to me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>But the chief was kindly sympathetic and soon had
drawn from Arden all the story. She told him everything,
about Sim&rsquo;s failure, her late return, about being
campused and having to hide in the packing case. At
this last the chief could not restrain a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why I wanted to find this man and claim
the reward,&rdquo; finished Arden. &ldquo;You see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I see,&rdquo; admitted the chief, going back
behind his massive desk. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sorry. I can&rsquo;t help
you any. We don&rsquo;t know where this missing young
fellow is any more than you do. But don&rsquo;t forget I&rsquo;ll
always be here if you need me, and I&rsquo;ll help you all I
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arden murmured her thanks, promised to remember,
and, bidding him good-bye, left the building. She
breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Standing for a composing moment on the sidewalk
in front of police headquarters, Arden looked up and
down the quiet street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my heavens!&rdquo; she suddenly exclaimed. &ldquo;Here
comes Toots Everett!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And indeed it was. Toots, with her hair freshly
finger-waved, was walking briskly in Arden&rsquo;s direction.</p>
<p>Without waiting to greet her, Arden cut across the
street and hurried back to the college.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<h2 id="c22"><br />CHAPTER XXII
<br />Arden Admits It</h2>
<p>The clatter of dishes and the clink of glasses vied
with the chatter of eager young voices as the girls
began their evening meal at Cedar Ridge. The dining
room was brightly lighted, and each table, seating
twelve students, was fully occupied.</p>
<p>Arden and her friends began passing the food
among themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold fish again!&rdquo; announced Jane Randall as the
waitress put a large dish of creamed salmon in the
center of the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And boiled potatoes and beans,&rdquo; Terry added before
that number of the bill of fare was in evidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you guess for dessert?&rdquo; Jane asked
Terry. &ldquo;Library paste or pie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terry considered a moment, during which time Sim,
on her left, held a heavy white plate beneath her nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Library paste&mdash;always on Tuesday,&rdquo; Sim finished,
giving the college slang name to cornstarch pudding
of a pale yellow hue. &ldquo;I could do nicely with some
extra food tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea, Sim,&rdquo; remarked Mary Todd. &ldquo;What
do you say we raid the kitchen later?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; agreed Sim. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get Arden, Terry, Jane,
Ethel, you, and me. That makes a good-sized party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You come for us, Mary,&rdquo; Terry suggested. &ldquo;Knock
on our door when you&rsquo;re ready to go, and we&rsquo;ll have
a feast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. It&rsquo;s settled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was quite possible in that noisy room to be talking
to one girl at the head of the table while the girl
at the other end knew nothing of the conversation. So
it was very surprising and equally diverting when
Elizabeth Kilmore, sitting some distance away from
Terry and her chums, announced forcefully:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gather round! I have some choice gossip!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have it!&rdquo; begged Sim. &ldquo;Brighten up our lives
a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got it from an upper-class girl who got it from
somebody else who had it from some other individual
along the grapevine route,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, &ldquo;that a
freshman has been arrested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; gasped two or three girls in a chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; murmured others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, at any rate, she was seen coming out of
police headquarters here in town this morning. What
do you make of that?&rdquo; asked the triumphant Elizabeth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>The girls looked at one another smilingly. Such
exciting rumors did not often come their way. It was
fun to speculate on the fate of such a student caught in
the toils of the police. Ah!</p>
<p>Arden, as the echoes of this choice gossip went
around the table, maintained a discreet silence. She
had not yet told her roommates of her trip to town
that morning, but she could readily understand, now,
that when they were back in 513 she would have some
explaining to do. But, for the time being, she decided
to try to change the subject. So she remarked casually:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was probably nothing. Lots of people in this
town look like college students. See how the natives
try to copy our clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always belittlin&rsquo;, Arden,&rdquo; remarked Terry. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
you let us enjoy the scandal? Heaven knows things
have been pretty quiet around here of late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you ask me, more likely it had something to do
with a minor traffic violation,&rdquo; Arden continued.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all very silly. Please pass the bread, Terry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terry reached for the bread plate but, at the same
time, shot Arden a quick appraising look. Arden took
a slice and innocently asked for further plans of the
night raid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll call for you girls in 513 about half-past ten&mdash;after
lights are out,&rdquo; Jane said.</p>
<p>The others nodded assent. The dishes continued
their barrage of sound, successfully concealing the
plans from those not included in them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>As Sim had foretold, at the close of the meal large
bowls of &ldquo;library paste&rdquo; made their appearance. Arden&rsquo;s
particular group decided to forego it and make
something else, later, take its place. Forbidden sweets
were always more tasty.</p>
<p>When the meal was at an end, the dean, suddenly
and somewhat out of the ordinary, signaled for silence
by tapping a bell kept for that occasional use at her
right hand at the faculty table.</p>
<p>Immediately a hush descended over the noisy room.
Miss Anklon arose and stood teeteringly and frostily
in her place, having pushed back her chair to make
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A story has come to my ears,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;to the
effect that a student of Cedar Ridge was seen at police
headquarters here in town today. It seems incredible
to me. However, I wish the girl who has allowed herself
to cause such a horrid rumor to circulate to come
to me before twenty-four hours pass and explain
herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave the bell another &ldquo;ding,&rdquo; and the conversational
flood was at once loosed again, but with new
import.</p>
<p>So the dean had also heard the rumor. Worse and
more of it!</p>
<p>Terry herded Arden and Sim through groups of
chattering and surprised girls, at the same time whispering:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Arden Blake, you know something about this!
Come upstairs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arden nodded silently. Sim objected to Terry&rsquo;s
bustling about and tried to hold back. But Terry, well
versed in the art of telling her friends something
without being overheard by others near by, soon had
Sim tractable and under control.</p>
<p>Safe in the sanctuary of their room, Terry started
in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Arden, what did you do this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be so smart, Terry! I didn&rsquo;t do anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But her face flushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know about the college student seen
coming out of police headquarters?&rdquo; demanded Sim.
&ldquo;Come on&mdash;come clean, as the detectives say&mdash;at
least, in books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know all about it!&rdquo; calmly replied Arden. &ldquo;I am
that girl!&rdquo; she announced in her best stage manner.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it,&rdquo; and she did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to Tiddy?&rdquo; Sim wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not&mdash;little one,&rdquo; drawled Arden, still
calmly but with firm decision, as her friends could tell
by the look in her eyes. When Arden made up her
mind, it was made up. &ldquo;It would be useless to explain,&rdquo;
she continued. &ldquo;Besides, I really didn&rsquo;t do anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;re found out, it might just as well be
murder&mdash;we&rsquo;ll all be sent home,&rdquo; Terry decided.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Terry,&rdquo; Sim agreed. &ldquo;We ought all
to leave for home before we suffer the ignominy of
being sent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not tonight, at least,&rdquo; Arden temporized. &ldquo;I may
as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb. I say let&rsquo;s
wait until something really happens. Besides, I think it
will be lots of fun to raid the kitchen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think Tiddy has any real evidence?&rdquo; asked
Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try to guess what we shall find to eat in the
raid,&rdquo; said Arden demurely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear roommate,&rdquo; laughed Terry, &ldquo;you are,
without doubt, a peer in the art of changing subjects.
But I do agree with you about the raid. We must all
wear tennis shoes and carry flashlights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get our work done quickly, then,&rdquo; proposed
Sim, &ldquo;and wait, with what patience we may, for Jane,&rdquo;
and she swept her chums a bow in her latest amateur
dramatic r&ocirc;le.</p>
<p>With unusual willingness, the three girls began to
open their books, look for pencils and paper, and soon
the room was in silence as they labored at their lessons
for next day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<h2 id="c23"><br />CHAPTER XXIII
<br />The Injured Chaplain</h2>
<p>The three freshmen in 513 worked diligently and
with a minimum of conversation. Now and then Arden
inquired about the spelling of a word, or Terry put
a question as to the correct ending of a Latin verb, but
on the whole their time was well occupied.</p>
<p>At about nine o&rsquo;clock the lights all over the dormitory
building were dimmed for a moment, a warning
that in five minutes more they would be extinguished
in every room. Arden announced happily that she had
finished her assignments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have, too!&rdquo; cried Terry. But Sim sighed deeply
as she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just made it. But I think my math is all wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; soothed Arden. &ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;re a
genius. Lots of them can&rsquo;t do math for a cent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lights went out suddenly, and the girls threw
themselves on their beds to await Jane Randall&rsquo;s
knock, summoning them to the pantry raid.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>Arden and her chums must have fallen asleep, for
they were startled when, some time later, Jane, afraid
of knocking too loudly on their door pushed it open
and tiptoed in. She groped her way to Terry&rsquo;s bed,
shook her and hissed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake up! It&rsquo;s time to go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; gasped the startled Terry, the other two
echoing her surprise with their own. They had no idea
that they had slumbered.</p>
<p>Silently they took their flashlights and crept down
the darkened corridor. The kitchen was far below on
the same floor with the dining room. The kitchen was
bright enough by day, for there were windows on
three sides, but it was as dark as a cave at night. A
large long table-bench ran the length of one side of
the room. On this the plates were served to be carried
into the dining hall by waitresses. Above the bench
were racks for holding dishes. Gleaming pots, pans,
and kettles hung on the wall near the huge stove, its
fire now banked for the night. Shining copper tanks
for hot water to make tea and boil the coffee caught
and reflected the beams from flashlights carried by the
marauders.</p>
<p>Unaccustomed to the strange place, the girls all
stood still for a few moments to get their bearings.
Arden gave a sudden frightened squeal as a startled
mouse ran across her foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;The place is overrun with the
little beasts!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; cautioned Jane Randall. &ldquo;That watchman
may hear us. He comes in here on his rounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the food, Jane?&rdquo; whispered Terry, advancing
farther into the room which, somehow, had a
spooky atmosphere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ought to be around here some place,&rdquo; Jane replied
cautiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah-a-a-ah! Pies!&rdquo; suddenly exclaimed Terry as
she opened the door of a large cupboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take a few. They are for tomorrow, I suppose,
and must have been baked late this afternoon.
What do they smell like, Terry?&rdquo; asked Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They all smell pretty much alike to me. I&rsquo;ll take
four, one off each shelf. We ought to get a variety
that way,&rdquo; suggested Terry.</p>
<p>The other girls were silently exploring, by means
of their electric torches, the dark corners of the
kitchen. They decided against taking bread or rolls
as being too unromantic for a midnight feast. Jane
convinced them that milk would do nicely to wash
down the food, and it was when Arden opened the
door of the immense refrigerator that she made the
prize discovery of the evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look what I&rsquo;ve found!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Two
roasted chickens!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lovely!&rdquo; breathed Sim. &ldquo;Come over here, kids!
Arden has struck a gold mine!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>Temporarily leaving their own investigations, the
other girls crowded around the ice box and focused
their lights on the innocent browned birds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sight of them makes my mouth water!&rdquo; announced
Sim. &ldquo;But we must have enough food, now,
with these as a background. Milk, pie and roast
chickens! Lovely! Let&rsquo;s take them and go quickly before
we are caught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arden reached in and lifted out one of the doomed
chickens. She turned half around to hand it to Sim,
who was waiting to take it, when the whole party of
girls was suddenly frozen into immobility with terror.</p>
<p>For through the silence of the night sounded mournfully:</p>
<p>Dong! Ding-dong! Dong! Dong!</p>
<p>It was the old alarm bell again sonorously clanging
at the mystic hour of twelve&mdash;the hour when &ldquo;witches,
warlocks an&rsquo; lang-nebbied things&rdquo; are free to roam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens! What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; gasped Jane Randall,
though well she and the others knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that bell again,&rdquo; said Arden unnecessarily. She
stood holding firmly to a leg of the chicken while Sim
dug her fingers into the soft browned flesh beneath a
wing. They laughed over it later, of course. But just
now terror gripped them.</p>
<p>Terry was holding the pies so tightly in her fright
that her fingers punctured the crust and went messily
into the fruit beneath. They all stood like children
who had been playing &ldquo;statues&rdquo;; in just the positions
they had assumed when that ghostly bell began to toll.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>It stopped for a moment and then began to peal
again, if anything more loudly than at first. Then the
girls came back to life, and while it was still clanging
the second time, Arden had presence of mind enough
to close the refrigerator door, to stave off discovery
as long as possible if the authorities entered the
kitchen. Then, with the other girls, who were also
holding to the food they had captured, Arden ran to
the low windows on the north side of the kitchen.
They all crowded close to the glass casement and
peered out into the night. The bell sounded more
clearly from this vantage point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can be ringing it?&rdquo; murmured Jane. &ldquo;I hate
bells or whistles in the night. It always seems so&mdash;ghostly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo; someone implored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to run around outside and find out about
it,&rdquo; declared Terry. &ldquo;Of course, it must be <i>someone</i>
pulling the rope. Bells don&rsquo;t ring of themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe the wind,&rdquo; suggested Mary Todd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wind couldn&rsquo;t ring that old bell,&rdquo; declared
Arden. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too heavy to be swayed by what little
breeze there is tonight. And it&rsquo;s high up on the wall,
under a sort of canopy. No, someone pulled that
rope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the rope is high up, out of reach from the
ground,&rdquo; said Sim who had noticed that fact.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>Puzzled, alarmed, and in momentary fear of being
discovered in the midnight raid, the girls stood at the
window. It was in a sort of extension of the building
and faced the north, so that from it a view could be
had of the rear college grounds leading down to the
orchard.</p>
<p>It was at this scene the girls were now gazing, some
illumination being furnished by a pale and watery
moon now and then hidden by scudding clouds.</p>
<p>Suddenly Ethel Anderson clutched Arden by the
arm, so violently as almost to cause the dropping of
the chicken, and Ethel exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that dark thing on the lawn near the
orchard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; asked several, crowding closer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; Ethel pointed at a moment when the
moon came out of the clouds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like a black dog, to me,&rdquo; Terry said. &ldquo;Or
perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terry&rsquo;s sentence was never finished, for Arden
broke in with:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a man! A man crawling on his hands and
knees! It is! Look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last wisp of cloud was wiped from the face of
the moon. The form of the crawling man was seen
plainly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, heavens!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must tell someone!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must wake Tiddy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s get out of here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Questions, exclamations, fearsome gasps and excited
advice all tripped pell-mell from the girls.</p>
<p>Then, quickly, Arden took control of the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, girls!&rdquo; she calmly advised. &ldquo;All of you keep
quiet. Now, just a moment, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her calm voice had its effect, and they all grew
quiet, though there was not one whose breathing came
naturally. Arden managed to raise the lower sash a
little way.</p>
<p>And then, through this opening, as the girls watched
the black, crawling figure, came a voice feebly calling:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help! Help! Help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Henny!&rdquo; exclaimed Terry as she and the
others recognized the squeaky voice of the aged
chaplain. &ldquo;Dr. Bordmust; and he&rsquo;s hurt!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<h2 id="c24"><br />CHAPTER XXIV
<br />The Dean Explains</h2>
<p>The mysteriously tolled bell had ceased ringing
now. Fascinated, the girls remained at the window
looking at the prone black figure of Rev. Dr. Bordmust
lying on the edge of the sinister orchard. That
the orchard was sinister at least Arden, Sim, and
Terry were ready to testify.</p>
<p>The last cry for help from the aged chaplain and
the final echo of the tolling bell came together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do, Arden?&rdquo; murmured Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must do something!&rdquo; insisted Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s sort of up to us, since we&rsquo;re here on the
scene,&rdquo; agreed Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dean will have to know about this,&rdquo; suggested
Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s something else to do first,&rdquo; spoke
Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; chorused her chums.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That poor man is hurt,&rdquo; went on Arden. &ldquo;He
needs help, and we must hurry to get it. I&rsquo;ll tell you
what. We three,&rdquo; she motioned to herself and her
roommates, &ldquo;are already campused. Whatever happens
can&rsquo;t make much difference to us, even if we&rsquo;re
caught now. We&rsquo;ll go out and see what we can do to
help poor Henny, and you others go tell Tiddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good idea!&rdquo; assented Sim. &ldquo;Jane, you and the
others can take the food with you when you go to tell
Tiddy. It&rsquo;s a wonder she or some of the others haven&rsquo;t
been aroused already by the bell. But when you go to
her, hide the food, somehow. No use wasting it after
all the trouble we had getting it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; said Ethel Anderson.</p>
<p>Quickly the two groups separated. Arden, Sim, and
Terry hurried out of a rear door, which they unlocked,
while Jane and the others, stuffing the pies, chickens,
and bottles of milk under their big sweaters, hastened
to take word to the dean.</p>
<p>Arden, Sim, and Terry ran with all the frightened
speed they could summon across the damp grass of the
rear campus toward the edge of the orchard. By another
gleam of moonlight they had a glimpse of the
chaplain resuming his painful crawling after a period
of rest following his cries for help.</p>
<p>When he saw the girls running toward him, Dr.
Bordmust, as if giving up the fight, now that assistance
was at hand, collapsed on the leaf-strewn ground.</p>
<p>Terry was the first to reach him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt, Dr. Bordmust?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;What
happened?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do tell us! Tell us how we can help you,&rdquo; appealed
Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you badly injured?&rdquo; faltered Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My leg&mdash;I think my right leg is broken,&rdquo; he faltered.
&ldquo;It is very painful. I cannot bear my weight on
it. That is why I had to crawl along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you fall?&rdquo; asked Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly. I was struck by something&mdash;something
attacked me as I was walking through the
orchard. It was some great, black, rushing shape that
threw itself upon me. I went down heavily&mdash;I could
feel the bones of my leg snap. I&mdash;I must have lost consciousness&mdash;for
a time, at least. When I came to, I
found myself lying beneath a tree. I managed to get
this far, and then the pain&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We heard you call for help,&rdquo; said Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You heard me&mdash;up in your room?&rdquo; His voice was
querulous.</p>
<p>The girls did not care to go into particulars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have sent someone to bring help,&rdquo; said Arden,
kneeling down beside the aged chaplain. &ldquo;But can we
do anything to ease you until help comes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rest yourself, Dr. Bordmust,&rdquo; Sim begged. She
sat down in the wet grass and lifted the tired white
head into her lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you are very kind, young ladies,&rdquo; the chaplain
murmured. &ldquo;I shall see that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; suddenly cried Arden as she
saw his head sag queerly to one side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s fainted, I guess,&rdquo; answered Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; wailed Terry. &ldquo;The poor man! But
here come the girls and the dean, I think, and two
men. Now we&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least he will, though as for us&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Arden did
not finish.</p>
<p>An excited throng of students and others hurried
toward the three alarmed freshmen surrounding the
chaplain. The dean, rather neatly dressed in spite of
the hurry under which she had donned her garments,
was in the lead.</p>
<p>Behind her was Miss Lucant, the college infirmarian.
Then came Jane and her chums with the
gardener, Anson Yaeger, and his helper, Tom Scott,
bringing up in the rear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly got a lot of help in a short time,
Jane,&rdquo; whispered Arden as the girls mingled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the dean was quick enough once she was
awake. She sent me for Miss Lucant and had one of
the girls telephone to the gardener&rsquo;s house to rouse
him. Tiddy certainly got organized quickly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Anklon, who even had the forethought to
bring a flashlight with her, focused it on the pale face
of the chaplain, who still was stretched on the ground,
his head in Sim&rsquo;s lap.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take him to the infirmary at once!&rdquo; the dean
ordered. &ldquo;Anson&mdash;Tom&mdash;you&rsquo;ll have to get some sort
of a stretcher to carry him. That leg, to me, looks to
be broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Arden.</p>
<p>The dean flashed a look and a gleam of light on her
but said nothing, nor did she ask how Arden knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to run back and get a board&mdash;or something,&rdquo;
said Anson. &ldquo;A stretcher is what we need,
but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can pull a door off the old tool-shed!&rdquo; suggested
Tom Scott.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do that,&rdquo; advised the dean. &ldquo;Lose no time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom Scott hurried off in the darkness, before Anson
could make up his mind what to do, and soon came
back with a light door. On this Dr. Bordmust was
carefully rolled, Sim pulling off her sweater to make a
pillow for his head, and then the gardener and his assistant
started on the melancholy journey to the college
hospital.</p>
<p>Having seen this procession on its way, the dean
spoke sharply to the nervous girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go at once to your rooms,&rdquo; she ordered. &ldquo;We
shall have something to say about this in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>Realizing that they could do nothing more, and
feeling that they must have excited the dean&rsquo;s curiosity
by all being dressed at that hour of the night, Arden
and the others hurried into the dormitory and dispersed
to their various rooms.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Dr. Bordmust, who had recovered consciousness,
was taken to the infirmary, where Anson
and Tom carefully undressed him and put him in bed,
with an elderly teacher, who was also a nurse, to look
after him. A physician was hurriedly summoned from
town and set the broken leg. This much the girls
guessed from observation and rumors that floated
along the corridor&rsquo;s grapevine route. For none of
those engaged in the raid felt like going to bed at
once.</p>
<p>And as the food had escaped the watchful eyes of
the dean, it having been successfully hidden under
sweaters, it was available for the post-midnight feast
which was soon under way. Nor was the usual caution
necessary, with the excitement over the chaplain&rsquo;s
strange adventure still seething.</p>
<p>As the girls ate they talked, naturally, each of the
two groups telling the other their parts in the affair.
They all admitted it was a queer mystery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think the bell had anything to do with it?&rdquo;
Sim wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might have been rung to draw our attention
away from the orchard,&rdquo; suggested Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no one was paying the least bit of attention to
the orchard in the first place,&rdquo; objected Terry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But why was Henny there in the orchard at midnight?&rdquo;
Jane Randall propounded. &ldquo;He had no business
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more than we had in the kitchen,&rdquo; suggested
Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he <i>was</i> there,&rdquo; declared Mary Todd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And something attacked him,&rdquo; said Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if you ask me,&rdquo; said Arden positively, &ldquo;I
think that whatever it was that came at us, the night
we had to get apples for the sophs, attacked our
chaplain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what was that?&rdquo; demanded Ethel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Arden had to admit.</p>
<p>The girls were silent a moment, and then Sim asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you have much trouble rousing Tiddy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jane answered, &ldquo;she sleeps like a horse. We
couldn&rsquo;t make her understand for the longest time.
She never even noticed how we all bulged with food,
and I think she didn&rsquo;t hear the bell at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they talked until there was nothing left to eat
though there was still much to wonder at. Arden hid
the milk bottles in a closet. Jane Randall opened the
door and was followed out by the other visitors to
513, who stole silently down the dark corridors and
to their own rooms.</p>
<p>In spite of all the excitement, Arden and her roommates
were soon sound asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>The next day the very walls of Cedar Ridge must
have vibrated, so great was the talk. Rumors of the
wildest sort were passed from girl to girl. Arden and
her friends were a little afraid to tell of their part in
the night&rsquo;s adventure and so listened to the various
stories and volunteered nothing.</p>
<p>At lunch, when the whole college was assembled,
Tiddy rang her little bell, and immediately a deep
hush followed the talk, laughter, and clatter of dishes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young ladies,&rdquo; began the dean, &ldquo;so ridiculous are
the rumors that are rife here today that I feel I must
do a little explaining. Rev. Dr. Bordmust, while strolling
through our orchard last night, was attacked by
a huge black ram which knocked him down, and in the
fall our chaplain&rsquo;s right leg was broken below the
knee. The ram, which it is learned is a savage beast,
broke loose from a near-by farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were uneasy twistings and turnings on the
part of the girls, and many whispered comments, despite
the frowning warnings of various teachers scattered
about the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you need have no further fears,&rdquo; the dean
went on. &ldquo;The beast has been caught and penned up
securely. It will be kept under restraint from this time
on. So no one need have any fears of going into our
orchard&mdash;if she has occasion to go there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So this is what the taxi-man must have been hinting
at,&rdquo; thought Arden. &ldquo;Though why he didn&rsquo;t dare
speak of it I can&rsquo;t imagine. And I suppose it was the
ram that knocked me down. I was lucky!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the explanation of the greater part of the
night&rsquo;s alarm, young ladies,&rdquo; continued the dean. &ldquo;It is
all very simple. It is unfortunate that Dr. Bordmust
was injured, but he is now resting comfortably, and
another clergyman has been temporarily engaged, so
there will be chapel service&mdash;as usual.&rdquo; The dean
smiled with dry humor, having noted flashes of joy on
the faces of several students at the idea of escaping
from morning devotions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Bordmust has asked me, as a favor to him,&rdquo;
stated the dean, &ldquo;not to punish the girls who were out
of their rooms against rules after hours. They kindly
went to his assistance and summoned much-needed
help. I am happy to accede to our chaplain&rsquo;s request,
for I know the whole undergraduate body is extremely
fond of him. I will ask no questions of those girls. In
fact, I hereby publicly thank them for their great
presence of mind. There is only one thing I must insist
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a portentous pause, and the dean ended
the silence by saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the ringing of the alarm bell was done as a joke&mdash;please
don&rsquo;t repeat it.&rdquo; She smiled benignly. &ldquo;Now
you may go on with your lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<h2 id="c25"><br />CHAPTER XXV
<br />Arden Is Convinced</h2>
<p>Silence&mdash;a somewhat stunned and portentous silence&mdash;followed
the dean&rsquo;s explanation and remarks.
Then a buzz of talk began. It spread all through the
room, for the orchard mystery had grown to greater
proportions than the faculty of Cedar Ridge had believed.</p>
<p>Arden secured the attention of Sim, who was excitedly
talking to Terry, and propounded this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you seriously think that what Tiddy said just
now is true? Or, at least, do you think it is a logical
explanation? It sounds fishy to me. If it was a ram
that hurt Tom Scott and the chaplain, the beast
planned his attacks with almost human cleverness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Sim answered. &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s
possible&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not probable,&rdquo; Arden interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s forget about it,&rdquo; suggested Sim.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; thought Arden as they finished lunch
and walked from the dining room to the sun-flooded
campus, &ldquo;I wonder if Sim is going to do anything
about the pool? She didn&rsquo;t seem much interested in
the way the dean solved the mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; inquired Terry. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you
satisfied, Arden, with the dean&rsquo;s statement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It satisfies me, Arden, m&rsquo;sweet!&rdquo; drawled Sim. &ldquo;I
find this sun very satisfying, too,&rdquo; she went on as she
stretched her arms high above her head and ran her
fingers through her thick hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, also, Terry?&rdquo; inquired Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Terry answered. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to look
further for doubters of the dean.&rdquo; She threw herself
down on the warm grass and opened her Latin grammar
for a last look before class.</p>
<p>Arden stood over her chums in uncertainty, for now
Sim had joined Terry on the grass. The sun was
bright, the sky unclouded and of a deep blue. Arden
pulled her bright red sweater down lower over her
tweed skirt and adjusted a small scarf about her neck.
Cedar Ridge was not a particularly &ldquo;dressy&rdquo; college,
nor did it have a reputation for displaying on its
campus carelessly dressed students. Rather a happy
medium was struck. High heels were out of place. One
could not make a swift last-minute dash up the boardwalk
to Bordmust Hall in open pumps, as several girls
had found out to their sorrow.</p>
<p>Arden and her chums dressed in sports clothes,
topped, usually, by the inevitable mortar-boards. Now
that hazing was over, the college settled down to a
peaceful routine, with not so much stress on the poor
freshmen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Arden finally remarked, &ldquo;I must say you
girls show very little of the stuff which made our country
the great place it is today. You have no curiosity.
That&rsquo;s your trouble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My trouble is not enough sleep,&rdquo; murmured Sim
drowsily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Latin will be the death of me,&rdquo; declared Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll leave you to yourselves,&rdquo; announced
Arden, turning away. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m off to see what I can see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not mad, are you?&rdquo; questioned Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, just curious.&rdquo; Arden was soon beyond talking
distance.</p>
<p>She was a little surprised, though she would not let
Sim or Terry know it, that they took the dean&rsquo;s explanation
so calmly and believingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; reasoned Arden to herself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to find out if an old black ram really caused all
the scares and trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once her mind was made up, Arden acted quickly.
Her next class was an hour away. There was time
enough, she knew, as she swung off in the direction of
the orchard. She went in through the hedge entrance.
It was dark and gloomy there, even with the sun shining,
and for a moment the girl hesitated. But she kept
on, and was soon in the grove of gnarled and fantastic
trees. The sun was shining down through their twisted
branches and glinting on the vari-hued apples. Arden
drew in a deep breath of a tangy perfume.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>She picked up a red and yellow apple, wiped it off
on her skirt, and bit into it. Distinctly it was good.
She walked on farther. All was serene. There was no
ram, no sign of a ram, though Arden did not really
expect to find one roaming about. But she did think
she might see the marks of the beast&rsquo;s feet. But she
saw none.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s no one lying here unconscious and injured
by any black beast,&rdquo; said Arden smiling a little
at her conceit. She walked over to a corner where
stood a shed in which were kept barrels and ladders
for the harvesting of the apples. It was nearly time
for the harvest now.</p>
<p>The door, that had been taken off for use as a
stretcher the night the chaplain had been attacked,
had been replaced. The door swung open, and Arden
had a glimpse inside the shed of various farm implements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho, hum!&rdquo; she yawned. &ldquo;I guess the girls and the
dean were right. There&rsquo;s no use trying to find anything
different. I shall have to admit I was wrong, and I
don&rsquo;t want to, for really I don&rsquo;t believe in that ram
story. If I could only find something else to bear out
my theory.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>She was looking around the orchard, gazing toward
distant corners for something she could investigate
when she was startled by a rustle of dried leaves
caused by some feet pattering rapidly among them.
There were a whistling snort and a loud sniff.</p>
<p>Arden wheeled about and screamed in terror.</p>
<p>Rushing straight at her, with lowering head and
menacing horns curved in the typical design of such
creatures, was an immense black ram. The animal
must have been hiding behind a tree. Attracted by
Arden&rsquo;s presence in the orchard, and perhaps incensed
by her red sweater, it had come to give battle.</p>
<p>Snorting in rage, like a miniature bull, and scattering
the leaves with his pounding feet, the ram was
coming on, Arden thought, like an express train. For
one wild moment she felt resentful against the dean
who had said the beast was now securely penned. Then
Arden turned and made a jump for the tool shed.</p>
<p>She got inside just in time, pulling the door after
her. And a moment later the whole structure was
shaken as the ram butted his horns against the thin
portal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my gosh!&rdquo; gasped Arden. And as there followed
a moment of silence and inaction on the part of
the creature, she saw a hook on the inside of the door
and slipped it into the staple.</p>
<p>Then came another butting attack on the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll break it in!&rdquo; cried Arden, her heart beating
fast. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t very strong. Oh, what shall I do? What
shall I do?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>The ram was snorting, puffing, and blowing outside
the shed. Arden could hear him pawing in the dried
leaves. Then for the third time he rushed with those
heavy curved horns at the barrier which kept him
from the human he wanted to attack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder Tom Scott and the chaplain were hurt
with such a creature as that rushing at them!&rdquo; gasped
Arden. &ldquo;Oh, dear! I wish I&rsquo;d taken the dean&rsquo;s word.
It&rsquo;s a ram all right. A terrible ram!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She wondered if a human voice in command would
have any effect on the creature. She would try.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away! Get out of here!&rdquo; she ordered through
a crack in the door. She waited. She heard nothing.
Perhaps the beast had gone. She loosed the hook a
little, making a crack wide enough out of which she
could look. The ram hadn&rsquo;t gone. He was balefully
eyeing the shed from a little distance, and when he
saw the door move again he lowered his head and
butted it harder than before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, this is awful!&rdquo; groaned Arden. &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll
have to stay in here until he goes away or falls asleep.
I suppose rams do sleep, sometimes. This is what I
get for doubting Tiddy. I wonder if there is a back
door that I could sneak out of while he&rsquo;s butting the
front one?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>But there was no rear exit, as Arden discovered
when she peered through the jumble of ladders, barrels,
and tools. Sheds aren&rsquo;t usually built with two
doors.</p>
<p>There was nothing to be done but to wait for a
rescue or until the ram should get weary of the siege
and raise it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the girls find out about this they&rsquo;ll have the
laugh on me all right!&rdquo; Arden ruefully mused.</p>
<p>The ram was quiet again, but Arden thought it useless
again to give any orders or to tantalize the brute
by partly opening the door. Time was passing. It was
getting late. She would soon be due at her class. If she
did not appear, her chums might think something had
happened to her and start a search.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t tell them where I was going,&rdquo; Arden
reflected. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t know where to start looking,
and they&rsquo;ll never imagine I came to the orchard after
all that&rsquo;s happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, to be in England, now that Spring is there&rsquo;&mdash;or
any old place but in this shed,&rdquo; the imprisoned girl
murmured. She was getting panicky. Almost without
knowing what she was doing, Arden found herself
shouting:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away, ram! Go away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused and caught her breath suddenly. She
heard voices outside; men talking. The sounds came
nearer. Someone said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That certainly was a mighty poor job you did on
that pen, Anson. The ram got out without half trying.
There he is now, down by the tool shed. And by
Jove, Anson, I believe he&rsquo;s got someone penned in
there! He wouldn&rsquo;t act that way unless there was
someone in the shed. Look, there he goes, butting the
door!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Tom Scott. Arden recognized the voice. And
Anson Yaeger, the grim farmer, answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did as good a job as I could with the wood I had.
I&rsquo;d like to see you or anybody else&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind that now!&rdquo; interrupted Tom. &ldquo;The
thing to do now is to catch that ram again! He&rsquo;s dangerous.
Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arden could hear footsteps running now, and
though the ram once more butted the door, nearly
cracking some of the boards, she knew that rescue
was on the way.</p>
<p>There was silence outside the shed for a moment,
and then Tom Scott said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You slip around back, Anson, and sort of hold his
attention by peering out at him around the corner.
While you&rsquo;re doing that, I can slip up behind him and
get this rope around him. I&rsquo;ll lasso him, and we&rsquo;ll hog-tie
him, cowboy fashion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; agreed the farmer.</p>
<p>Arden could not see what they did, but she was told,
later. Tom, who had provided himself with a noosed
rope when he and Anson started out in search of the
escaped ram, skillfully tossed it over the beast&rsquo;s head
from the rear. The noose fell in a choking loop around
the ram&rsquo;s neck, and Tom pulled tight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>The surprised animal turned to charge Tom, but
by this time Anson attacked him with a heavy timber,
knocked him down, and both men threw themselves
upon the creature. He struggled and bleated, but was
soon well tied so he could not move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good work, Anson!&rdquo; complimented Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; was the grunted answer. The farmer was
winded.</p>
<p>Arden was debating with herself whether to come
out and show who the ram had imprisoned or to wait
until the men had taken the beast away. But she had
no choice, for Tom said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll see what unfortunate this ram was
after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going out,&rdquo; Arden told herself and unhooked
the door.</p>
<p>Tom Scott and Anson fairly jumped with surprise
as they saw her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He chased me in here,&rdquo; she volunteered. &ldquo;I got in
just in time, but I didn&rsquo;t dare come out again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s wise you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Tom, smiling at her.
&ldquo;This is a dangerous beast. I thought he was after
someone, the way he stood near this shed. Your red
sweater must have attracted him. Not hurt, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, only frightened. At least I was. I&rsquo;m so glad
you came.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he can&rsquo;t hurt you now,&rdquo; chuckled Tom,
looking at the bound ram. Anson said nothing. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
a tricky beast. Worked his way out of the pen we shut
him up in temporarily until his owner can dispose of
him. I believe the dean has threatened to make a complaint
unless the ram is removed from around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he goes,&rdquo; said Arden. &ldquo;The orchard will be
safer without him and less&mdash;less mysterious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mysterious?&rdquo; questioned Tom, somewhat wonderingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But I must be going. I&rsquo;ll be late for my class.
Thank you for rescuing me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a pleasure,&rdquo; Tom said, bowing and smiling.
&ldquo;Also a pleasure to choke the beast that gave me such
a whack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still Anson Yaeger did not speak. He seemed to be
glaring at Arden with his little beady eyes almost
hidden under shaggy brows. But Arden was looking
only at Tom Scott. She could not seem to help it. And
he was looking at her. Arden began to feel embarrassed.
It was as if, she said later, she had met the
good-looking gardener at some previous time but could
not remember where. She was puzzled and annoyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I really must go!&rdquo; she announced, and this
time she did, hurrying past the bound and recumbent
ram that seemed to eye her with much malevolence.
But he was helpless now.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>Arden hurried up through the orchard, turning for
a final look at the scene of her latest adventure. She
saw Anson bringing a wheelbarrow out of the shed to
be used in taking the ram to a new prison. Then she
ran to Bordmust and reached it just in time for English
lit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<h2 id="c26"><br />CHAPTER XXVI
<br />The Challenge</h2>
<p>Terry and Sim were in other rooms, so Arden did
not see her chums until after the last class of the day.
Then she met them on the steps of Bordmust, where
they usually waited for one another.</p>
<p>If ever Arden astonished Terry and Sim, it was on
this occasion, when she related her startling adventure
with the ram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, never!&rdquo; gasped Terry in disbelief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; asserted Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my aunt&rsquo;s cat!&rdquo; shouted Sim, and then she and
Terry went into spasms of laughter. Though they
realized Arden had been in some danger, the funny
side of it was now uppermost in their minds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go over to the orchard and look around,&rdquo;
suggested Terry as their mirth subsided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be anything to look at, now that
Arden is out,&rdquo; said Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; answered Terry, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d like to see what
the place looks like now that the danger is removed
and the mystery solved.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re one of those persons who go around
gathering souvenirs from houses where murders have
been committed,&rdquo; laughed Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sort who sneaks up on the Sphinx and knocks
a chip off the nose for an Egyptian tidbit,&rdquo; suggested
Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; urged Terry. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t anything
else to do, and we can&rsquo;t go anywhere, as we&rsquo;re still
campused, and it&rsquo;s a nice day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; assented Sim.</p>
<p>The girls were in a jovial mood as they started
toward the orchard, which had been bereft of some
of its peril and mystery by the dean&rsquo;s announcement
and by Arden&rsquo;s rather perilous adventure.</p>
<p>This was several days after the night of the kitchen
raid, the ringing of the bell (which was as yet unexplained),
and the attack on the aged chaplain by the
vicious black ram. During those days the college had
buzzed with talk and rumor, and among the chums
of Arden and her two friends considerable was known
about the midnight taking of the chickens, milk, and
pies.</p>
<p>But the bottles had surreptitiously been restored to
the kitchen, the bones of the chickens had been successfully
disposed of, and there was nothing left of the
pies save a few grease spots on several sweaters.
Whether the dean knew about the raid and chose to
ignore it or whether she was still in blissful ignorance,
Arden and her friends neither knew nor cared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I think she knows all about it but
doesn&rsquo;t say anything because of what we did for
Henny,&rdquo; said Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyhow, she hasn&rsquo;t piled any more punishment on
us, so why should we care?&rdquo; asked Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Arden. &ldquo;But though that
part seems to have blown over, we still haven&rsquo;t found
out why Henny was in the orchard at midnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we probably won&rsquo;t until you locate that missing
Pangborn chap and get the reward so the swimming
pool can be repaired,&rdquo; said Sim, a little sarcastically,
it seemed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk about it!&rdquo; begged Arden. &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m
a failure as a detective. As for the pool, perhaps
around Christmas we can prevail on our respective
families to chip in and subscribe enough to fix it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a thought!&rdquo; exclaimed Sim. &ldquo;I must remember
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What the dean publicly had said about the ram was
quite true in the matter of its ugliness, as Arden could
testify. A farmer not far from the college grounds
owned the big black brute, kept for stock exhibitions.
It was larger than the average ram, with immense
horns, curving back over a hard head, and when free
would run to attack any persons who crossed its path.
The beast was supposed to be kept secure in a barn or
field but had managed to get out more than one night,
roaming afar, and was said to have killed several dogs
which had had the temerity to attack it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Probably it was attracted to our orchard by the
apples,&rdquo; suggested Terry as the three walked along,
talking of the brute&rsquo;s acts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been attracted to me also,&rdquo; murmured
Arden as she recalled the circumstances of the
hazing and how she was knocked down by what she
thought was a dark whirlwind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henny couldn&rsquo;t have been in the orchard as a hazing
stunt to be attacked by the beast,&rdquo; said Terry
thoughtfully. &ldquo;What was he there for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps wandering under the midnight stars to
think up a theme for a sermon,&rdquo; suggested Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; said Arden, though her voice had no conviction
in it. &ldquo;Well, here we are,&rdquo; she added as they
left the campus lawn and found themselves under the
first row of trees in the orchard. It was the first time
since the hazing they had entered it without fear or
apprehension. It was very calm and peaceful this
bright morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was right about here,&rdquo; said Arden, indicating
the base of a large tree, &ldquo;that the ram knocked me
down that night, and over there is the shed where I
locked myself in,&rdquo; she added, pointing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there is where we found Tom Scott,&rdquo; Terry
said, indicating the spot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Terry,&rdquo; said Sim, breaking off a twig from
one of the old gnarled trees. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a souvenir for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, darling,&rdquo; remarked Terry sarcastically.
&ldquo;What kind of apples are these, anyhow?&rdquo; She picked
up a fairly good windfall and gingerly took a small
bite after shaking off an ant or two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any idea,&rdquo; answered Arden, and then, as
she remembered something, she suddenly asked: &ldquo;Oh,
Sim! What about that man you saw in the orchard
with a lantern the night Mr. Newman brought you
back from New York?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; said Sim. &ldquo;Why, it must have been
someone looking for the ram, who was on the rampage
then. How disgustingly simple mysteries always
turn out to be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so simple,&rdquo; Arden objected. &ldquo;How about the
bell and the missing Pangborn chap?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;well,&rdquo; Sim temporized. Then, as a distant
rustle of footsteps in the dried leaves was heard, she
added in a lower voice: &ldquo;Here comes your hero!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arden glanced toward where Sim indicated. Tom
Scott, the good-looking young fellow who was assistant
to grim and dour old Anson Yaeger, was
swinging along beneath the trees toward the girls. As
he caught sight of them he paused, looked behind him
as if to see that a way of retreat was clear, and then,
with a shrug of his shoulders as if shaking off a weight,
advanced again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>Not only to the eyes of Arden, but to those of her
chums, it was evident a great change had taken place
in Tom Scott. For one thing, he no longer wore blue
overalls. He was attired in a well-fitting gray business
suit. Instead of clumsy boots his feet had on neat ties
well polished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How nice he looks!&rdquo; murmured Terry. &ldquo;Why!&rdquo;
she exclaimed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s shaved off his mustache. I&rsquo;m sure
he had one when I saw him raking up leaves a couple
of days ago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he has,&rdquo; agreed Sim. &ldquo;But what of it? I think
he looks better without it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! He&rsquo;ll hear you,&rdquo; warned Arden. She was
staring in a strange manner at the young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming right this way,&rdquo; went on Sim in a low
voice. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we do something besides standing here
and staring at him as though we came here purposely
to see him? Walk, talk&mdash;do something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s pretend we&rsquo;re after some apples,&rdquo; suggested
Terry, stooping down but gathering only a small
nubbin.</p>
<p>Sim followed her example, but Arden appeared to
be fascinated by the oncoming Tom Scott. She did not
move or speak. She just stared at him in a way that
would have drawn rebukes from her chums had they
seen her fixed gaze.</p>
<p>Tom Scott came on, grinning cheerfully, as he was
close to the girls, disclosing white, perfect teeth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Altogether too good-looking for a gardener at a
girls&rsquo; college,&rdquo; Sim found herself reflecting as she
looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we thought we&rsquo;d take a few apples,&rdquo; faltered
Terry. &ldquo;I suppose there&mdash;there&rsquo;s no&mdash;objection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time she and Sim were aware of Arden&rsquo;s
queer actions or, rather, lack of action, for Arden was
still motionlessly staring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try one of these,&rdquo; suggested Tom Scott, reaching
up and picking off a perfect apple from a branch
over his head. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find the flavor rather good.&rdquo;
He handed the apple to Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said, in a toneless voice. &ldquo;What
kind is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spitzenberg. A very choice variety. You&rsquo;ll not find
many of them around here. This is the only orchard I
know of where they grow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How nice&mdash;I mean how strange,&rdquo; murmured
Arden. She was not looking at the apple. She was
looking at Tom Scott, and she asked: &ldquo;Have you recovered
from your&mdash;your accident?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; He laughed. &ldquo;You mean when the black
ram butted me? For it was the sable beast that
knocked me out. Yes, thank you, I&rsquo;m all over that. It
wasn&rsquo;t much. Too bad I didn&rsquo;t do for that beast before
he had a chance at the chaplain. He fared worse than
I did&mdash;the chaplain, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he did,&rdquo; agreed Sim. &ldquo;But you saved Arden
from the same ram.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It so happened,&rdquo; admitted the good-looking
gardener.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Terry as Tom gave her an apple
like the one he had handed to Arden and then passed
one to Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I must be going,&rdquo; said Tom Scott. &ldquo;I have
an errand in town and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute!&rdquo; cried Arden excitedly. In all this
time she had not removed her gaze from the young
man&rsquo;s face, not even to munch her apple, as Terry and
Sim were doing with theirs. &ldquo;Wait, please&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young gardener stood uncertain, his eyes roving
from one girl to the other and back to Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; faltered Arden. &ldquo;I know! Yes,
I&rsquo;m certain now! You are Harry Pangborn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arden!&rdquo; gasped Sim. &ldquo;Arden!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you saying?&rdquo; exclaimed Terry, dropping
her half-eaten apple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the man we saw in the post office!&rdquo; went
on Arden, her words and breath coming rapidly. &ldquo;I
mean he&rsquo;s the picture we saw&mdash;I mean he is the
original of the man wanted in the police poster. You
are, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she challenged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<h2 id="c27"><br />CHAPTER XXVII
<br />A Telegram</h2>
<p>For a moment it seemed as if the young man was
going to deny Arden&rsquo;s statement or at least flee from
the scene. But again he smiled in a disarming and
friendly fashion, shrugged his shoulders as though
getting rid of another weight, and, spreading his
hands in a helpless and surrendering gesture, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am Harry Pangborn. You have found me
out. I thought it wouldn&rsquo;t be long after I shaved off
my mustache. Well, I&rsquo;m just as glad it happened this
way since it had to happen. I was about to end the
little masquerade, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please let us end it!&rdquo; begged Arden. &ldquo;I mean
if we are allowed to tell&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She seemed confused
and blushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; said young Mr. Pangborn. &ldquo;Well,
have it your way. I would rather see you profit by it
than anyone else. You did me a favor the night the
ram came at me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what does it all mean?&rdquo; asked Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you give up your inheritance of millions
to come here as a gardener&rsquo;s helper?&rdquo; asked Terry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a short story, simple enough, and perhaps you
may not believe it,&rdquo; said Harry Pangborn, &ldquo;but I just
didn&rsquo;t want my inheritance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not your grandfather&rsquo;s wealth?&rdquo; asked Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps it would be more exact to say I was
in no hurry for it. Oh, I&rsquo;m not going to pass it up
altogether,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;But here&rsquo;s the story briefly.
As the poster explains, I disappeared about the time I
was to inherit a large sum. But there was nothing
criminal in it, and I wasn&rsquo;t kidnaped as some thought.
All my life I have wanted to be the owner of a big
farm estate, ever since I used to go to my grandfather&rsquo;s
farm when I was a boy. I knew I could inherit
the farm all right, but I wanted to know something
about running one, especially an orchard, since I
hope to raise fancy apples.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I figured that the best way to learn from the
ground up, so to speak, would be to get a job on a
farm or an orchard. I knew I couldn&rsquo;t do it under my
own name. I&rsquo;d have a lot of tabloid paper reporters
after me&mdash;a millionaire apple grower and such rot. So
I just quietly disappeared, as I knew those in charge
of the estate I was to inherit would object, and I roved
around. I finally landed here, and I may say I like the
place very much.&rdquo; He smiled frankly at the three attractive
girls. &ldquo;I liked everything about it but the ram.
But now the time has come to end the masquerade.
I&rsquo;ve learned what I wanted to learn. Old Anson is a
good teacher, if he isn&rsquo;t all he should be in other ways.
He taught me many secrets of the soil.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you happen to come to Cedar Ridge?&rdquo;
asked Arden. &ldquo;The poster said you might be found
around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it did. I ran a risk in coming here. But I
didn&rsquo;t just happen to. You see, my grandfather and
Rev. Dr. Bordmust are old college chums. I had that
in mind when I came to this college farm as assistant
gardener. In case of accident I wanted someone who
knew me to know where I was. So I told my story to
your chaplain, swore him to secrecy, though much
against his will, and then I just let matters drift along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than once Dr. Bordmust urged me to give
up what he called my mad scheme, and he half
threatened to disclose everything. But I prevailed on
him to wait just a little longer. But finally, one night
just before he was hurt by the ram, he came to see
me in my garden residence and said he would keep
silent no longer. Then, as I had gotten all I wanted
to in the way of apple knowledge, I agreed to do the
disclosing myself. This made Dr. Bordmust easier in
his mind. It was when he was going home through the
orchard, after leaving me, that he was attacked. I
can&rsquo;t tell you how badly I felt over it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was too bad,&rdquo; agreed Arden, still gasping
with astonishment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; broke in Sim, &ldquo;was it you who rang the
alarm bell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry Pangborn smiled again and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! It was Anson who did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anson!&rdquo; chorused the surprised three.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I am on my way to the dean now, before I go
to town, to tell her she had better get rid of her
gardener. I can do it freely, as it can be proved I have
no ulterior motive since I am giving up my place. But
old Anson is a man with a warped mind and a queer
sense of humor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did he ring the bell?&rdquo; asked Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how?&rdquo; asked Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He reached up with a long-handled rake and
tangled the teeth in the rope,&rdquo; said Mr. Pangborn.
&ldquo;That was his method. As for his reason, well, it may
have been one of several.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But slyly ringing the alarm bell with the rake and
then running away wasn&rsquo;t all of his peculiar sport,&rdquo;
went on Mr. Pangborn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else did he do?&rdquo; asked Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once I caught him perched up on the ledge of one
of the high gymnasium windows, peering in. He
jumped down and ran away as I came along the walk,
but I had a chance to see him, and also to note that he
was wearing some kind of a mask, that of an evil old
man.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; gasped Sim. &ldquo;The face you saw at the dance,
Arden!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it must have been,&rdquo; Arden agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, then you saw that trick?&rdquo; asked Mr. Pangborn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just had a glimpse of a face at the window,&rdquo;
Arden answered. &ldquo;Then the bell rang, and we all
hurried out to try to solve the mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that was the night,&rdquo; young Mr. Pangborn
agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what could he hope to gain by such a trick?&rdquo;
asked Arden. &ldquo;He really didn&rsquo;t frighten me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that was to have been the start of a campaign
on his part for a certain purpose,&rdquo; the late Tom
Scott answered. &ldquo;He probably thought the girls would
report to the dean about a strange face peering in at
them out of the night. Then Anson, very likely, might
have offered to drive the Peeping Tom away, which he
could easily do by just ceasing his own antics. In this
way he would be commended, I think he expected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strange!&rdquo; murmured Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must be crazy!&rdquo; echoed Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think,&rdquo; asked Arden, &ldquo;that he may have
done it all as a joke? Perhaps he was joking the time
he threatened Terry and me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pangborn indicated his disbelief in the joke
theory by shaking his head. Then he added:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He may have had very queer ideas as to what was
a joke, but I really think he was building up a case for
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A case for himself?&rdquo; asked Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. When he had rung the bell enough times and
it had become a sort of terrifying mystery, I think he
intended to have it solved in a way that would not implicate
him and so gain credit and perhaps a raise in
wages. That&rsquo;s only a theory, but it may be true. One
night I spied on him, discovered his trick, and was preparing
to denounce him when the chaplain forced me
to give up my masquerade. So it&rsquo;s all over, and you
are the first, outside of Dr. Bordmust, who knows my
secret. And I suppose you won&rsquo;t keep it long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We just can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Arden. &ldquo;As soon as I saw you
coming along just now I knew you were the man of
the poster. I half recognized you before, but the mustache
deceived me. I&rsquo;ve done a lot of foolish things
trying to remember the two faces&mdash;yours and the one
on the poster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyhow, Arden,&rdquo; said Sim, &ldquo;it was fun
doing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was,&rdquo; Arden agreed. &ldquo;But, Mr. Pangborn,
will you let us notify the police or lawyers and claim
the reward?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would prefer to have you notify the lawyers,&rdquo; he
said genially.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want the money for ourselves,&rdquo; Terry
made haste to explain. &ldquo;We are going to give it to the
dean to have the swimming pool repaired for Sim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Sim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; exclaimed Arden, indicating the blushing
Miss Westover. &ldquo;She threatens to leave college because
she can&rsquo;t go in the pool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arden!&rdquo; rebuked Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you will let us notify the lawyers that you
are here?&rdquo; persisted Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please!&rdquo; begged Terry in a way she had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he laughed, &ldquo;I suppose I must. I guess my
little adventure is over. Go on&mdash;tell on me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How wonderful!&rdquo; cried Arden, while Sim and
Terry looked at each other happily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had about made up my mind, Arden,&rdquo; said Sim,
&ldquo;not to go home after all. Now, of course, I&rsquo;ll stay,
with the prospect of the pool. I&rsquo;ll stay until I&rsquo;m sent
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine, Sim!&rdquo; Arden declared. &ldquo;Everything is
coming out so beautifully!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can have the pool fixed, Sim isn&rsquo;t going to
leave us, and the horrid old ram is caught,&rdquo; murmured
Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the mystery of the bell is explained,&rdquo; added
Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you a piece of paper?&rdquo; suddenly asked Mr.
Pangborn after a vain search in his own pockets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We nearly always carry books and papers,&rdquo; said
Sim, &ldquo;but this morning&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She looked helplessly at
her chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; exclaimed Arden. &ldquo;Use the back of this
envelope. It&rsquo;s the letter you gave me to keep, Sim. I
was always afraid she&rsquo;d mail it herself if I left it
around,&rdquo; she explained to Terry, &ldquo;so I&rsquo;ve been carrying
it with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She handed the crumpled envelope to the young
man, who had managed to find a pencil, and he wrote
on it quickly. He handed the envelope back to Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a telegram to my lawyers.
Sign your name, send it, and the reward is
yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t run away meanwhile, will you?&rdquo; asked
Arden shyly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll stay around or go and give myself up, as
you direct&mdash;just so you&rsquo;ll get the money.&rdquo; He seemed
happy to comply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, so much!&rdquo; Arden said warmly. &ldquo;Do you
mind if we go send this telegram right away&mdash;before
we have to report in class?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run along,&rdquo; he said, laughing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go telephone
my people and relieve their anxiety. Though I don&rsquo;t
really believe they were worried. I&rsquo;ve traveled pretty
much around the world alone and been out of touch
with them for months at a time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo; chorused the three freshmen as they
literally &ldquo;ran along&rdquo; to the main building to telegraph
the surprising message to the lawyers named on the
poster. Harry Pangborn, a quizzical smile on his face,
watched them go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was fun while it lasted,&rdquo; he murmured as
he swung on through the orchard. &ldquo;And I think it did
me good. Those are mighty pretty girls. I wouldn&rsquo;t
mind knowing them&mdash;after I come into my kingdom,&rdquo;
he chuckled. &ldquo;Perhaps I may. Who knows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl at the college telephone switchboard was
almost as excited as the breathless Arden, who asked
to be connected with Western Union and then dictated
the startling news of the missing heir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will be something for the papers!&rdquo; thought
the telephone operator. And it was&mdash;later.</p>
<p>Terry and Sim waited impatiently outside the booth
for Arden to emerge. Girls clustered around them,
and many were the exclamations of wonder, delight,
and surprise as the news was told.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we must go inform the dean,&rdquo; said Terry as
she came out, flustered but triumphant.</p>
<p>On the way to Miss Anklon&rsquo;s office the girls passed
the college post boxes, where each girl had a niche of
her own, with a dial lock, for incoming mail. Sim
begged them to wait while she looked in her box.
There was a letter slanting to one side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I have one!&rdquo; Sim announced as she twirled the
combination and took out the missive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s it from?&rdquo; asked Terry before Sim had half
read it. But she was quick to answer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s from Ed Anderson. He wants me to go to a
dance during the Thanksgiving holidays. I didn&rsquo;t think
he&rsquo;d ever speak to me again after the way I disappeared
at the tea dance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this news Arden and Terry decided to look in
their boxes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not so much!&rdquo; Terry cried. &ldquo;I have a letter
myself. It&rsquo;s from Dick Randall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me too!&rdquo; announced Arden, succinctly if not
grammatically. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s from Jim Todd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What fun!&rdquo; exclaimed Sim. &ldquo;And the holidays begin
the end of next week.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<h2 id="c28"><br />CHAPTER XXVIII
<br />A Disturbing Message</h2>
<p>Hardly realizing the good fortune that had come
to them so unexpectedly, and while they were rejoicing
over their letters and the prospects of the Thanksgiving
holidays, with dances in the offing, Arden,
Terry, and Sim saw one of the college messengers
making her way toward them through a throng of
other students. For the messengers were young women
who, like the waitresses, were working their way
through Cedar Ridge by making themselves useful to
the dean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a message for you,&rdquo; said this girl, without
smiling. She looked at Arden but included Sim and
Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A message for me?&rdquo; Arden exclaimed. Could the
Pangborn lawyers have sent the reward money by
telegraph already?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you three young ladies must report to the
dean at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; faintly whistled Sim.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the idea?&rdquo; asked Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered the bearer of
what was generally considered ill tidings. &ldquo;But you
had better see her at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; urged Arden. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get it over with.
I had half a mind to go there, anyhow, and tell her
the news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe she&rsquo;s heard it already,&rdquo; suggested Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More likely,&rdquo; suggested Sim gloomily, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s
heard we were trying to flirt with the good-looking
assistant gardener and we&rsquo;re going to be expelled. If
she sends us home, Arden, don&rsquo;t you give her a penny
of that reward money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; exclaimed Terry. &ldquo;Not a cent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Arden doubtfully, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
and then she urged her two chums on toward the
dean&rsquo;s office while little groups of other girls, among
which strange rumors were filtering, watched the three
freshmen, with a variety of expressions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; greeted Miss Anklon as Arden knocked.
And when Sim and Terry had filed in behind her it
needed but one look at the smiling face of the dean
to let them know they were meeting her on a different
footing than ever before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Tiddy was actually <i>grinning</i>!&rdquo; Sim told some
of her friends later.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Please be seated, young ladies,&rdquo; invited the dean,
indicating chairs. &ldquo;And, not to make them anxious
seats for you, I may say that news of your good fortune
has preceded you here. Mr. Pangborn has just
left me and has told me all about it. I congratulate
you, and I hope you will put the reward money to
good use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a chorus Arden, Terry, and Sim breathed audibly
in relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And about the bell,&rdquo; went on Miss Anklon. &ldquo;I am
sorry if, even remotely, I suspected you or any of the
girls of that trick. I shall make a public announcement
about it. Sufficient to say now that I have dismissed
Mr. Yaeger as gardener and we shall have a new one
in a few days. I never realized what a strange mind
he had until Mr. Scott&mdash;I should say Mr. Pangborn&mdash;enlightened
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arden and her chums began wondering if this was
all the dean had summoned them for&mdash;to congratulate
them and inform them about old Anson. It was not in
her nature to be thus trifling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is not all that I asked you to come here for,&rdquo;
resumed the little dark-faced dean. &ldquo;It was to warn
you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Her telephone rang, and she had to pause
at a most critical point as she answered into the instrument,
saying: &ldquo;I am engaged now. Call me in five
minutes.&rdquo; Then to the waiting three: &ldquo;I want to warn
you not to talk too much about this matter for publication,
for I realize that it must get into the papers
and I desire no unseemly publicity for the college.
Also, I wish to caution you about wildly spending that
thousand dollars reward which, Mr. Pangborn informs
me, will soon come to you. I wish&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Anklon!&rdquo; Arden could not refrain from
interrupting, though she arose and bowed formally as
she did so. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Mr. Pangborn tell you what we
are going to do with the money as soon as we get
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that nice of him?&rdquo; whispered Sim to Terry.
&ldquo;He knew we would get a kick out of telling for ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Miss Anklon,&rdquo; went on Arden, &ldquo;we have
decided, we three, for Terry and Sim will share the
reward with me, we have decided to donate it to the
college.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the college?&rdquo; The dean plainly was startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. To repair the swimming pool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A momentous silence followed Arden&rsquo;s dramatic announcement,
and then the dean said, &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Er!&rdquo; She was plainly taken by surprise and was
as near to being flustered as the girls had ever seen
her. But she found her voice and usual poise in a
moment and said, with as much warmth as she was
capable of:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, young ladies, this certainly is most generous
of you. I cannot adequately thank you now. That will
come later&mdash;more formally and publicly. But are you
sure you want to do this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Miss Anklon!&rdquo; answered Sim and Terry
together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We decided that long ago,&rdquo; added Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it is indeed fine of you,&rdquo; Miss Anklon said,
fussing with the papers on her desk and not looking
at the girls. &ldquo;You have shown a very laudable college
spirit.&rdquo; The three freshmen smiled a little weakly and
shifted about. &ldquo;I can be generous, also, young ladies!&rdquo;
the dean remarked more firmly as she looked at them
again. &ldquo;I think your gift deserves some immediate recognition.
That is&mdash;suppose we forget all about your
being campused?&rdquo; she asked, and smiled disarmingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; murmured Arden and her chums. For they
had felt hampered by the campus rule even though
they had not strictly kept it. Then Arden added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you ever so much! We appreciate it ever so
much!&rdquo; And she told herself: &ldquo;Hang it, I meant to
say &lsquo;greatly&rsquo; in that second sentence.&rdquo; But the dean
smiled again, held up a restraining hand as Terry and
Sim evinced indications of opening up a barrage of
thanks, and with a dismissing gesture said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you will want to tell all your friends the
good news. You may go now, and&mdash;I hope you enjoy
yourselves!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Really, she&rsquo;s human after all!&rdquo; murmured Sim as
the three hurried down the hall to find anxious girls
awaiting them.</p>
<p>Then such talk as buzzed in Cedar Ridge was never
known before! Arden, Terry, and Sim were overwhelmed
with questions, and their room resembled
Times Square at a subway rush hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This rates another pantry raid!&rdquo; declared Toots
Everett who, with other sophomores, came in to congratulate
the three.</p>
<p>That second pantry raid was much more successful
than the first, which had, however, ushered in the
solution of the orchard secret and the ending of the
peril beneath the gnarled trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s to our holidays!&rdquo; exclaimed Arden at
the midnight feast, drinking from a glass of milk in
one hand. The other held a piece of pie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long may they wave!&rdquo; chanted Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pass me some chicken,&rdquo; mumbled Terry.</p>
<p>A week later, after many crowded hours, and perhaps
it may be said after as minimum an amount of
study as was ever noted in Cedar Ridge, Arden and
her friends were waiting on the station platform at
Morrisville for the train that was to take them home
for the Thanksgiving recess.</p>
<p>Jerry Cronin, the taxi-man who had first driven the
three to the college, was sauntering around waiting for
a fare. He smiled at the girls, and they nodded. They
knew him better now, for they had frequently used
his car.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re glad it&rsquo;s all over,&rdquo; he remarked,
coming closer to where they stood and taking off his
cap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That there orchard business. You know,&rdquo; he was
almost whispering now, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t tell you about it at
first. I dassn&rsquo;t. But I warned you, didn&rsquo;t I? Here&rsquo;s how
it happened. Now that old Yaeger is gone I can tell.
I caught him up to some of his tricks once, making
scares and all that. And once I saw him drive that
old black ram into the orchard at night. I couldn&rsquo;t
figure out why, but now I know. That there young
gardener told me. Yaeger was planning some credit
for himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep, I caught him at it, and when he saw I knew,
he threatened that if I told he&rsquo;d see that I didn&rsquo;t get
any more college taxi trade, so I had to keep still. But
now I&rsquo;m glad I can tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;re glad it&rsquo;s over,&rdquo; said Terry.</p>
<p>The girls resumed their own talk as the taxi-man
walked away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it thrilling when Arden gave the dean the
reward check!&rdquo; Sim exclaimed, her arm through
Terry&rsquo;s.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly was! And wasn&rsquo;t Harry Pangborn nice
when he posed for those newspaper photographers?&rdquo;
Sim inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swell!&rdquo; laughed Arden. &ldquo;And the party the girls
gave us last night in the gym&mdash;lovely! Everything has
been just wonderful. I can hardly wait to get home to
tell Mother and Dad all about it. I could write so
little in my letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget our dance Thanksgiving eve,&rdquo; Sim
reminded her chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if we&rsquo;d forget&mdash;when those nice boys are coming!&rdquo;
exclaimed Arden. She turned to look at the
college. The buildings were outlined by a glorious red
sunset. &ldquo;I can understand, now, how one becomes attached
to one&rsquo;s Alma Mater. Cedar Ridge <i>is</i> a dear
old place,&rdquo; she concluded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to think,&rdquo; murmured Sim, &ldquo;I wanted to leave
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said Terry, &ldquo;I can understand. I&rsquo;d
have done the same thing if I was as crazy as you are,
Sim, about being an expert swimmer and diver. You
couldn&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>The girls lapsed into silence and looked at the gray
stone buildings standing so bravely in the gleam of the
red sun. The chapel spire seemed to pierce the blue
sky and the white clouds now beginning to be tinted
with rainbow colors. Bordmust Hall seemed to peer
shyly at the departing girls from its distant hill. In the
window of his official manse, Dr. Bordmust, recovering
from his injury, looked out of a window near
which he was propped up and smiled.</p>
<p>The girls waved friendly hands at him, and he
waved in return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A jolly gentleman, after all,&rdquo; commented Terry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must call on him when we come back,&rdquo; suggested
Arden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we will be coming back,&rdquo; murmured Sim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; exclaimed Arden. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to
have a lot more adventures at Cedar Ridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I doubt if any will be like the ones we&rsquo;ve just
finished,&rdquo; laughed Terry.</p>
<p>That remains to be seen. And those who are curious
to learn may do so in the next book of this Arden
Blake mystery series. It will be entitled <i>The Mystery
of Jockey Hollow</i>.</p>
<p>The girls walked on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Sim suddenly exclaimed, pointing to the
swimming pool soon to be repaired. Its windows were
a glory of red and gold from the setting sun. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
doing its best to announce the fact that it will no
longer be a despised vegetable cellar. Oh, girls, I&rsquo;m so
happy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So say we all of us!&rdquo; chanted Arden.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>The puffing train came at last and stood at the station,
panting for breath, it seemed, as if to get up
courage to take away so many happy, laughing, chattering,
and joy-bubbling students. As it pulled out of
the station along a row of bare trees, the three freshmen
of 513 had a glimpse of the stone deer of the
campus looking at them with startled eyes.</p>
